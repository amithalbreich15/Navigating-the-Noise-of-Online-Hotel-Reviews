Very Good,"Only complain I had was the Shuttle driver was the rudest we can across. We had landed and call the hotel to get the shuttle to pick us up. We waited 20mins, when the hotel was 10mins away. Within minutes we saw the shuttle pass by, he didn't even stop to get us, he just passed by with no acknowledge of his stopping. So we called the hotel again, they made him turn around for us. Once we came back, he stopped and started yelling saying next time to stand on the street and stop him. He didn't even bring our luggage up, the whole way to the hotel he was complaining and speaking out loud. Once we got to our destination, he didn't offer once again to get our luggage's.

"Nice stay, Awesome Staff, Needs some upgrades!","So, the hotel is nice, but some upgrades would elevate the experience, especially considering that it is in the city with the biggest cruising port in the world. The breakfast lacked variety and was just okay. The breakfast sausages could be switched up with bacon or turkey sausage for some variety, add some breakfast potatoes, grits, biscuits, sausage gravy, danishes, maybe. The laundry facility has older coin operated machines, but the room does not have a change machine and the front desk didn't have any quarters. Monthly maintenance checks/repairs would catch minor problems that detract from the customer experience (the wallpaper in our bathroom was peeling near the bathtub, the sound on our TV was wonky).","First of all, the staff was awesome! The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping kept our room clean and comfortable and made sure the common areas were always clean. The pool area was clean and inviting with plenty of seating and shady areas to relax. The business area was very comfortable for sitting and the computer and printer were free to use.

Reasonably priced. Convenient shuttle to and from airport and/or cruise port.,"I did not like that I called for the shuttle from the airport, was told it would be about 15 minutes.  One came but said he was full and that another would be by in 10 minutes and we would need to wait.  After 15 minutes I called the hotel again requesting a shuttle since one did not come back.  I was told it would be 20-25 minutes! In total we waited over an hour to finally get a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, which was only about 15 minutes away!  I appreciate that it was no charge but didn't appreciate how long we had to wait at the airport after traveling most of the day.  Also, our room on the surface appeared clean until I decided I wanted ice.  When I grabbed the ice bucket, I found the previous guests' keys in it!  Apparently they had been calling for a few days asking if the hotel had found their keys! So someone not only does not do a thorough job cleaning but also does not do a thorough job of checking for items left from a previous guest practically in plain sight!","The location was good, meaning it was close to the airport as well as close to the shipping port.

The room was clean, but  a little shabby for the price point, but hopefully it will be included in the remodel. The bus to the Port was late. We ended up taking an Uber. I asked several times if the bus would get us there by 12pm and was assured it would. We left at 1210pm and it still was not there. There were at least 50 people waiting for it so by the time everyone and their luggage was loaded there was no way it would be there on time. Most of the staff were very nice and helpful.

Super location with shuttles from the airport to cruise terminal.,"Check in was easy.  Staff attentive. Later it was harder to get one to look up from over her phone to answer a question (which she didn't really answer exerting  minimal effort) so I decided to just leave it until the morning.

I didn't like that the elevators came directly off the street, and anyone could have gotten on and gone straight past lobby to room areas. 
We could have told hotel in advance the time we needed to be at the cruiseport, but it was not mentioned.  S0 we had to take the ultra early one, as it was all that was left. 3rd party bus to cruise was loaded with gum under trays and seats and the driver was a crank.  He walked right past us others of his liking, and then into lobby.  I had to follow him to ask if the unmarked bus was to the port and he answered irritatedly.  Sped through the tunnels like we were on rails.  We appreciated transport, but it was like Mr. Frog's Wild Ride on a prison bus.","Breakfast was great!  Loved the selection, and the breakfast room was sunny.  Wish the pool had a ""swim at your own risk"" sign because after arriving, we were hotttttt, but checking out before it reopened, and the pool looked inviting, even after dark.

A shuttle appeared across the other side of the road not over to me considering I had 4 pieces of luggage 🧳 2 large suitcases luckily they all rollovers. I couldn't help but read the drivers face he looked upset like maybe he had to turn back for me or something. I wouldn't intentionally inconvenience persons otherwise I might have tried to get Uber or taxi. Nevertheless I am grateful I got on to make airport early enough to get my international 10 am flight. The driver unloaded everyone including my luggage I said thank you  to him and he just looked at me like I was the lowest species.  I'm not asking him to smile and kiss my feet I just wanted him to know I appreciated his service and trouble he probably had just to come and pick me up. But I just felt he seemed prejudiced towards me.

When we got to the hotel, there were lots of taxis arriving at the same time.

We waited 20mins, when the hotel was 10mins away. Within minutes we saw the shuttle pass by, he didn't even stop to get us, he just passed by with no acknowledge of his stopping. So we called the hotel again, they made him turn around for us. Once we came back, he stopped and started yelling saying next time to stand on the street and stop him. He didn't even bring our luggage up, the whole way to the hotel he was complaining and speaking out loud. Once we got to our destination, he didn't offer once again to get our luggage's.

You get what you pay for (sometimes not even that).,"1. Advance communication regarding the shuttle times was lacking (couldn't tell me until the day prior what the shuttle times were).
2. Room wasn't ready. When checking in a family of 4 to a room with only a king bed, the staff member knew we needed to use the pull-out bed (I asked if another room was available and he said ours had a pull-out, so we should be fine), but neglected to provide any bedding. Had to make 2 separate trips to the lobby: one for the bed sheets and another for a pillow (didn't have any on-hand behind the desk). 
3. Since we arrived very late due to flight delays, my wife and kids went straight to bed (it was 4am). I requested the pillows, and had a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door. The attendant brought it up and I waited by the door for a gentle knock, which never came. Instead, several minutes later he chose to call our room to announce he had pillows. The super loud hotel phone woke everyone up - my wife, and my 3- and 6-year-old exhausted kids. I went back down to the lobby for the pillows to be told he didn't knock because of the sign on the door. So instead of the gentle knocking (acceptable), he called our room, which was 10x louder and more intrusive. And it required my second trip to the office.
4. Finally, the shuttle driver had no customer service skills. His personal interactions were unprofessional, curt, and difficult to understand. There were supposed to be 2 shuttle runs that morning: 11:30am and 12:30pm. As of 12pm, the 11:30 shuttle was still sitting there. We were scheduled for 12:30pm to make port by 1pm, and thankfully were able to join the earlier run (they ended up only doing 1 run).","Location was fine. Close proximity to the airport.

Don't depend on the shuttle.,"We booked this hotel because it advertised both a free airport shuttle and free cruise port shuttle. Before booking,  I called the hotel to confirm they had both and we would be able to use both. I also asked about their breakfast since our child has food allergies, they let us know there would be options for him in the breakfast.

Upon arriving we were told there would be no more room on a shuttle to the cruise port. Because of this we had to pay $60 on an Uber.  There was also no gf option for my son for breakfast.   It could be a super easy fix to just have an allergen friendly cereal option.  As for the shuttle, they should change the way it was advertised.

Same the day after, I came down to get the bus back to the airport and was told it's every hour, yet there is no information on this displayed anywhere or sent via email anywhere. They can order me a taxi was the suggestion the uninterested morning male receptionist told me. The issue is that they share the bus with 3 other hotels so have no control over it.

They also had a place to store our luggage until our rooms were ready. They got us into them as soon as they became available. Also  we had to use a Lyft to the airport the next morning as the shuttle didn’t run until 630 am and our flight was at 615 am.",10,November 2023,"November 24, 2023",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds - Non-Smoking,1,Group,8.1

Wouldn’t recommend to anybody.,"This is by far the worst hotel we’ve stayed at. The reason we booked here was how close it was to the airport and the free shuttle service. We ended up waiting almost 1 hour and a half for our shuttle because one of the busses got into an accident, which is understandable. But there wasn’t any apologies, nobody seemed to know what had happened and kept saying that another shuttle was going to be there shortly. When we got to the hotel, none of the staff offered an apology or even an explanation. We found out about the accident because of the driver. When we spoke to the manager, he said we would get a partial refund and it never happened.

Never stayed at the Comfort Inn & Suites near the Miami airport.  Any idea on a partial refund?,"Could not cancel my reservation through booking. com., even though i had the itinerary number.

Lauderdale.  But I couldn't do a thing because I booked the room through Booking.com. There was no way to get in touch with  them, even using my itinerary booking number.  So I lost the money spent on the reservation with no recourse.

As I stood at the counter he proceeded to tell me that my name was on this list. He failed to verify my phone number on this waiting list. He did not tell me that I needed to go on it. He assumed that I was part of the group with the same last name.  He just assumed that my name was the same name as the one on the list and that I would be called. Well. I was never called for my reservation and I almost didn't get a reservation and my name was almost not even put on the list. I had to get stern with the employee and told him this is unexcusable for the service. As I bantered with Amanda that this was unfair treatment, she got on it and went beyond the call of duty and got us checked in. The guy who so called put me on the wait list shrugged it off as no big deal. All this happened on June 17th,2023. Personally, I will not stay at this hotel again.

This was a horrible experience,We selected this hotel because it had free shuttle services from the airport and to the Port of Miami for a cruise. When we arrived after flying for over 20hrs to check in and be added to the shuttle list they say all the shuttles are full. They never said that when we called this hotel on multiple occasions. They claim you could only be added to the list upon check in and it’s first come basis but they don’t tell you they only run three shuttles a day to the port. So we will have to find our own transportation. Which again was the reason we selected this hotel. The hotel itself is very Dingy and old. Floors are disgusting and the carpets have stains that look like mold. There was hair in the shower and the breakfast was blah at best. The staff will tell you anything just to get you out there face and act like they don’t want to be bother. This is a very disappointing start our vacation. This place is worse than Motel 6 especially for the price. In addition the elevator is so outdated it malfunctioned in mid ride.Never again! 👎🏾,Nothing,1.0,October 2022,"October 9, 2022",King Room - Non-Smoking,1,Couple,8.1

Won’t be staying here again.,"The desk clerk for the night shift was very friendly, but was most likely resting in the employee room in the back when I needed him. I landed at 1 am and called the hotel from the airport 3 times to get the hotel shuttle to pick me up, but no one picked up. I ended up having to pay for a lyft to get to the hotel. 

I later called while at the lobby to check and the telephone was at the front desk, but of course the clerk was at the back and there was no one to check me in. I called out for him and ended up having to knock on the door for him to come out. After that though, he was extremely friendly and quickly granted me the late check-out I was requesting.

There is a communication and attitude problem with the other staff though. The cleaning lady was not notified I was checking out late and woke me up at 11 am through knocking, trying to open my door and calling out.

Then there was the alarm testing. At 10 am someone called my room to tell me there was alarm testing at 11, but I didn’t pick up because I was asleep. At 11, an extremely loud alarm came on and completely woke me up. You really can’t do this after the late check-out time at 12? After the cleaning lady’s knocks, it just felt like the hotel was trying to kick me out of the room. I called the front desk to ask what was going on and in a someone exasperated tone they told me they were testing the alarm in a “sorry not sorry” kind of way.

will not stay here again,We where on vacation for a Disney Cruise and there where other guests for the same reason. on the day we had to leave they only had ONE elevator working for all floors we almost missed the cruise and when asked for help and we had a disabled friend they said that there is nothing they can do.

Lesson learned! I really wish I had taken photos but was pretty nauseated by the condition of the flooring mostly!,"I was told there was a 24 hr shuttle by reservation desk, it’s also stated on website. This isn’t true it only runs until 12 midnight therefore after our flight we had to pay a cab! When I questioned this, I was told a third party was told by “email” multiple times to change the 24 hr statement. There was also a 24 hr shuttle to cruise port…they don’t tell you there is a limit of times and passengers who must make a reservation, yeah! The carpets were disgusting and I mean years of filthy stains and bleach stains…nasty! The baseboards in hallways were equally disgusting…the room was dirty on the clean side considering the shape of the rest of the property. The staff really didn’t give a flip about your shuttle worries and it was apparent…anyways never again!","It was a great location, that’s about it!",3.0,April 2023,"April 10, 2023",King Suite with Sofa Bed - Non-Smoking,1,Family,8.1
