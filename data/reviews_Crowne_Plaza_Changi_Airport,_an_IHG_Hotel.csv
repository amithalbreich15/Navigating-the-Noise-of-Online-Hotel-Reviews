Great hotel for an overnight stop-over.  Suited for business travellers.,"We didn't like that the reception is located on the ground floor and not on the terminal floor.  The lift was not well sign posted, so you are faced with the prospect of taking the stairs or the escalator - both difficult with heavy cases.   staff were very helpful, though.","Location is perfect if you are stopping over in Singapore, but do not want to go into the city.  You can catch the transfer train from terminal one (which is where we arrived) and get off at the next stop.  This it is a 5 min walk to the hotel.  It is not very well sign posted, so needed help from a very helpful person we happened to bump into while looking for it.   I think he could tell we were lost.",9.0,August 2024,"August 14, 2024",1 King Bed Standard Jewel Wing,1,Couple,8.7

Accidentally saw behind the sink frontal stone cover from the side, which is open, and it's awful dirty there. The glass cabin bathroom wall is fancy, but never dark in.this room, we ended up walking without lights on. 

The tv in our room had a chinese subtitle, which we were unable to turn off. Limited channels, complicated use, send error several times showing no internet connection.

The chaos of light switches in our room. Never found the right one.

Seating service for breakfast. As an adult couple, we weren't enjoying sitting next to a family of four with a bothering young girl ( around 10) who was very active for the whole time we spent our breakfast. Previously, we had luck couple of times and had beautifully calm brekkies, but not this time. There were a lot of empty tables around, so this should happen for some other reason.

Table cleaning service at breakfast. I had approached 5 times while my mouth was full with my breakfast. Once to try a new green brekky cocktail, one's to fill out a quick survey, 3 times to take an empty plate. While I understand they must keep the table clean, in my culture, we let ppl finish eating before approaching them. Maybe it's okay in Singapore.","Very polite, professional working culture.

Totally smitten with this hotel in every way....will be back.,The only thing I can think of is adding a few more packets of coffee....2 is not enough :),"We stayed in Premium Room #914 facing the Jewel rooms of the hotel and the Jewel.  Terminal 1 is a short walk.  
Check in was so efficient - in fact we arrived early from our cruise ending and expected to wait but we got so very lucky with a room being available.  
The Premium rooms have all you could ever want and I have to say that the set up in this room is totally guest friendly....pleasing colours, very clean and even though next to a runway, you could hardly hear any planes - most left early evening.  Lots of plants around the hotel, so pleasing.
Layout is such that you can both lay out a large suitcase without having one on the floor or bed to muddle through and leave it that way until you are ready to leave.  Large desk area, Coffee/tea, water supplied - plus you can always pick up more down in the gym.  Empty mini fridge.  Space to hang up clothes, dark curtains with sheers over, iron and board, a super wonderful bed to sleep in and the bathroom is wonderful.  Lots of counter space, bright, big shower stall and a bathtub.  Soft fluffy towels,  Excellent water pressure.
We had Breakfast  included and it was excellent....full buffet.
The pool...wonderful, like being in a tropical oasis when swimming or chilling with a drink.  At an airport?? who would ever know.  We did take taxis to Gardens by the Bay at around 20 SGD each way...very reasonable.  
They have recently spent millions on enhancements and it shows....someone has put a lot of thought into what hotel guests would like.  Busy busy but each person is special.  Front counter staff so friendly and throughout the hotel all you meet are exactly the same.  
The perfect spot to be to visit the Jewel as well...what an amazing place - filled with tons of places to eat, to shop and of course watch the waterfall...especially in the evenings when a light show takes place....totally smitten.",10,April 2024,"April 15, 2024",1 King Bed Standard Jewel Wing,2,Couple,8.7

Totally smitten with this hotel in every way....will be back.,The only thing I can think of is adding a few more packets of coffee....2 is not enough :),"We stayed in Premium Room #914 facing the Jewel rooms of the hotel and the Jewel.  Terminal 1 is a short walk.  
Check in was so efficient - in fact we arrived early from our cruise ending and expected to wait but we got so very lucky with a room being available.  
The Premium rooms have all you could ever want and I have to say that the set up in this room is totally guest friendly....pleasing colours, very clean and even though next to a runway, you could hardly hear any planes - most left early evening.  Lots of plants around the hotel, so pleasing.
Layout is such that you can both lay out a large suitcase without having one on the floor or bed to muddle through and leave it that way until you are ready to leave.  Large desk area, Coffee/tea, water supplied - plus you can always pick up more down in the gym.  Empty mini fridge.  Space to hang up clothes, dark curtains with sheers over, iron and board, a super wonderful bed to sleep in and the bathroom is wonderful.  Lots of counter space, bright, big shower stall and a bathtub.  Soft fluffy towels,  Excellent water pressure.
We had Breakfast  included and it was excellent....full buffet.
The pool...wonderful, like being in a tropical oasis when swimming or chilling with a drink.  At an airport?? who would ever know.  We did take taxis to Gardens by the Bay at around 20 SGD each way...very reasonable.  
They have recently spent millions on enhancements and it shows....someone has put a lot of thought into what hotel guests would like.  Busy busy but each person is special.  Front counter staff so friendly and throughout the hotel all you meet are exactly the same.  
The perfect spot to be to visit the Jewel as well...what an amazing place - filled with tons of places to eat, to shop and of course watch the waterfall...especially in the evenings when a light show takes place....totally smitten.",10,April 2024,"April 15, 2024",1 King Bed Standard Jewel Wing,2,Couple,8.7

One of the lady’s that was at reception was very very rude and did not want to help me at all !!! First thing she said to me when I asked if I could book a room was sorry I can’t help you or book a room for you and you must book the room online and once that’s complete I can check you in at 9am or 10am . I said that’s not a problem at all I can do that, once I did that and showed her that I booked it she said “that’s great you booked it” I can’t check you in before 12pm. I understand there is hotel rules and policy’s but this lady’s focus is not customer service at alll !!!!!! She must go she was rude and arrogant and if she doesn’t like her job go find another one.

There was a lovely man that came and helped me when I came back around 11am he was wearing glasses he got me my room ready within half an hour and got me into the free breakfast buffet !! Put me on the highest floor so I can rest and get some sleep as I had been travelling without sleep ! This is what you call customer service !!",It’s great for a layover !!!!!

"Comfy, unique and a real bucket list item.","It was an expensive one night stay, but we were happily willing to part with  the money for the magical experience of being so close, and watching the planes.

We avoided having to taxi anywhere but did have to go through the immigration process which we had hoped to avoid being a transfer.","We were there for a 23 hour stop over and were fortunate enough to check in 90 mins early with no extra charge. 

Rachel at reception welcomed us like celebrities. She gave us great suggestions for special events and shows at The Jewel to see during our stay.

Best hotel bed I've ever had. Plush and comfortable. 

Extensive room service menu for all tastebuds. A bit pricey but was all delicious and exceeded expectations.

Laying and watching planes taking off and landing from bed was something so niche and my husband loved it. Can cross that off the bucket list.

Express checkout was a breeze, bonus of being able to pay via eftpos when room service was brought up, which cut out that time having to settle a bill when leaving.

Shower had a beautiful rainfall shower head with great pressure and got super hot. Beautiful complimentary toiletries were a bonus.",8.0,March 2023,"March 27, 2023",1 King Bed Standard Runway View,1,Couple,8.7

Ideal to break a long flight en route to Europe & to de-stress late arrivals and early departures.,"We used this hotel as a ""bookend"" to a week's stay in Singapore.  On arrival it was great to be able to walk off the plane into a very nice hotel room with bath and King-Sized bed, rather than to have a take a cab into the city and take up another hour or more to check into a city hotel.  With a 12-noon checkout, this could comfortably be left until the following day.
At the end of our week in Singapore we had an early flight home.  Again, we chose to overnight at Crowne Plaza, taking the rush out of checking out of a city hotel to get to the airport by 7:30am to check into our flight.  We spent a pleasant and relaxed late afternoon and overnight at Crowne Plaza Changi and simply walked from the hotel to the departure gate after an early breakfast.
One puzzling aspect was that on arrival on the inward and outward stays the hotel reception staff went to some lengths to point out that as we have booked through Booking.com we weren't actually entitled to the benefits usually offered to IHG Members such as an upgrade to the higher room category.  Thankfully, on both occasions, after pointing out that it would be better if we booked directly, the check-in staff did actually upgrade us to a superior room category. 🤔","Room was generous in size and appointment.  Breakfast was an extensive buffet and good value.

Our objective for a good rest was not realised due to faulty air conditioning problem.,"My daughter who has stayed with you when on business in Singapore strongly recommended that we have a break on our way home from London. After the long flight from London my wife and I booked the room so that we could get a good rest before continuing on to Sydney the next evening.  We had some dinner before we went to bed a couple of hours after our flight arrival but the room was freezing and the air conditioning temperature could not be adjusted.  After wrestling with the problem for some time I finally realised that there must be something wrong with the controller. I rang reception who sent up a maintenance person to investigate.  He was very courteous and after inspecting something in the ceiling found that it could not be rectified quickly and arranged with reception for us to move to another room.  This was done but it meant that we had to re pack our belongings throw on a gown and move all and sundry a few rooms down the hallway.  The staff again were very helpful but by the time we got settled, several hours of our room booking had passed before we were able to try to get some rest, which was the main objective of our stay so your question about value for money can only be answered by saying that our own experience with our crown stay was not the same good value that my daughter experiences.",Room was well presented and very clean.

The Hotel is AT but not INSIDE Changi Airport,Beware. When looking at booking.com it seems like the Crown Plaza is IN the airport. However it's AT the airport. Right beside in fact.

Great and very convenient stay at the Crowne,"Even though the room was almost perfect - clean, spacious and comfy, there was one thing that was annoying. Our room's toilet had some extra sewage holes apart from the one in the shower - we assumed this was to make cleaning easier.  However, the one nearby the toilet was expelling some nasty sewage smell. While it was not a powerful smell and didn't leave the toilet, it was enough  for us not to fully enjoy our experience at the Crowne. We (sort of) solved this by moving the toilet bin on top of it, but still...","My stay was truly great. My partner and I booked Crowne Plaza at Changi because we had a layover of 15ish hours. Not enough time to go to city centre, and too long to stay around the airport (regardless of how great Changi is!). We decided to go to Crowne Plaza at the airport. Aligned to how well designed the airport is, this Crowne exceeded expectations. The lobby is modern, the staff was very accommodating and friendly and the room was clean and spacious. Apart from the convenience of the hotel's location (which is perfect for long layovers), what I liked the most was the way this hotel was designed: Rooms are not connected through aircon closed-corridors, but instead through a nice open space that connects to the pool - like how you would get from some beach resorts - topping it up with an outside view from the Jewel.",9.0,June 2022,"June 13, 2022",1 King Bed Standard Jewel Wing,1,Couple,8.7

I asked if I could pay for a late check out and was unsuccessful.

"Disappointing, over-priced stay in a non-accessible room","I booked an accessible room well in advance, but was told upon arrival that they had given all of them away. None of the staff I spoke with seemed to understand that by giving us a non-accessible room they were essentially giving us a bed, but no bathroom. The front desk repeatedly told us that a non-accessible room would be fine because ""it is big and close to the elevator"" (not understanding the other features of an accessible room). We were also assured that if our assigned room wasn't suitable, we could call down and they would find a solution. However, once I saw the room (which was definitely not accessible) and called the help desk, they reiterated that there was no other room since they gave the room we booked away. In the end, we had a very difficult stay, made only slightly better by the assurance of a shower chair to our door. However, in the end, they only brought up a cheap plastic stool - not a shower chair that provides balance and support. Just to clear: before leaving a negative review, I tried resolving this in two other ways: (1) I asked for a refund BEFORE accepting the keys (so I could find an alternative hotel) but was told it wasn't possible since the booking was through Booking.com and (2) contacted the company directly several days ago, but have yet to hear back.",,3.0,July 2024,"August 1, 2024",Standard King Room - Disability Access,1,Couple,8.7

Decline in customer service. Disappointing experience,"We recently revisited the Crown at Changi Airport, a place we'd enjoyed on multiple occasions in the past. Unfortunately, this stay fell short of our expectations, primarily due to ongoing renovations that significantly impacted our overall experience.

One major letdown was the breakfast, once a highlight of our visits. The temporary setup in a function space lacked the charm of the usual dining area, and the food selection had dwindled to a mere 10% of its former glory. It was a far cry from the delightful mornings we remembered.

However, the most frustrating aspect of our stay revolved around the bed arrangement. Despite booking a room for two adults and a child, we were initially provided with a baby cot that was impractical for our almost 4-year-old. Upon requesting a proper bed, we were met with resistance and told it was a last-minute request, with an additional charge of $60 for an extra bed. After persistent communication, a bed was begrudgingly provided, leaving us disheartened by the service quality.

It's disconcerting to witness such a decline in service standards over the past year. We can no longer wholeheartedly recommend the Crown at Changi Airport, as our recent experience has left us questioning the value and hospitality that were once synonymous with this establishment.",,3.0,December 2023,"December 22, 2023",King Location Room - Non-Smoking,1,Family,8.7

-0*,"The hotel was being refurbished, I was warned about this prior to my arrival, originally I had booked a Junior suite with pool access but the hotel sent me a message before our trip explaining that they would upgrade me to suite should the work still be continuing in December, so I stupidly kept booking..

Upon arrival I was given a room near the top floor, there was no mention of my room being unavailable, which I felt was poor so I had to then ask the reception staff what room it actually was that we would be staying in, I was told I had been given an upgrade to a suite due to the refurbishment.

Room 819 - discusting old and tatty, it was basically just a Junior suite but with no pool access so I was basically paying for a downgraded room to what I originally booked.
I was appalled at how disgracefully decorated the room was and how tatty simple things were like the curtains, furniture, decor etc.
I rang downstairs to reception straight away to tell them that the room was not up to standard and surely was not a suite as it just looked like a horrible version of the room I originally booked but without pool access. I was then informed by another member of staff who actually brought up in conversation that we were in the same type of room as we originally booked as I think she was confused..So not only had I been lied to by the first member of staff but also by the admin team who messaged me prior to our arrival.
I literally said to the staff that this can't be an upgrade as it was a disgusting room on the 8th floor dark dingy and in need of TLC.
I was as honest and truthful about my feelings on the matter of the room being so poor that I just asked the staff ""please do you have any nicer rooms at all"" it was as simple as that after taking time away to try and sort a different room out we were left waiting for ages only to be told they have no rooms available.",Nothing,1.0,December 2023,"December 8, 2023",Junior King Suite with Pool Access,1,Couple,8.7

The staff could only provide the location of a retail spa location in Jewel. It was quite a distance from the hotel and availability was very limited. We chose the hotel so we could unwind and enjoy the convenience of onsite facilities of a hotel of this caliber.

Badly designed rooms for sleep and poorly managed hotel - Avoid,"When we arrived we were given room 512. My understanding is most rooms of the standard we had booked were similar in that the bathroom/toilet is basically a glass box so you can full view from the adjacent bed and tv area. But who in there right mind wants to watch your partner on the toilet?  At 11pm we retire to bed however we are receiving bright lights from the two outside windows on the bathroom external wall, which opens out into the open landing outside our room! We could not sleep. So I point this out to reception and they give us another room on the 8th floor, which was identical, i.e. the same problem! I go back down to reception and their response was some guests like the room set up. I had shown the problem to the staff member who accompanied us to room 512, who was unable to come up with a solution. I described the issue to 2 different reception staff who were unable to come up with a solution. I spent the rest of the night and morning in the lounge area awake. I asked for a cup of coffee as the 4* hotel offered 24 hour service, but I was declined. The reception staff said we could bring you coffee to your room but not to the lounge area. I said I didn't want to disturb my wife by ordering room service, and anyway the coffee machine was in the restaurant next to the lounge area! Sorry she replied you can only order from your room!!",Nothing! The hotel is badly managed by inexperienced staff. The cost of £275 a night is unrealistic as the hotel offers poor value of a 2* hotel standards rather than the 4* advertised. My experience and advice is avoid at all costs.

"Loved everything,  but the cleanliness","Honestly loved my stay, but there was one big issue for us: there was a lot of wear/tear in the room and the cleanliness of the room was not up to my expectations, with the room rate in mind and considering this is Singapore.

Eg; a lot of dents in the wooden furniture,  lines between the tiling seemed to contain dirt/mould in the bathroom. Stains on the ceiling. The carpet was not thoroughly cleaned: crumbs, hair and other debris clearly visible. Dust on visible parts of eg the television, dirt/spots under cubboards. What icked me out the most was that the glass separating the room from the bathroom was filthy; you could see grease from hands and other things on the glass, a lot of scratches, etc.

We should have immediately mentioned it to the staff, but we came off a long haul and went to sleep. Felt wrong to complain only 8hrs later.

Truly loved this hotel, but the cleanliness was not up to par.","-Runway view room is an AVgeeks dream. 24/7 spotting opportunities. Nothing beats waking up in front of some A380s, A350s and 777s. Defenitly worth the upcharge!

Very clumsy was the front desk telling us our Mastercard was declined and us having to rush to get money and calling Mastercard, because of that almost an hour for checkin after a 12 hour flight is not great, only to find out the card was fine and it was the frontdesks fault by not asking for a pincode when it was needed. We got there at eight so we had 2 hours of shopping and by this mistake we also ended up with only half the time before Jewel stores closed as an added bummer. Offer somebody at least a drink or whatever as this was beyond a simple excuse.","Room nice and clean and pretty big.
