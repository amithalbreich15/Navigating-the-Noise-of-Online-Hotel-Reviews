Good,"I don't know if my room's unit happened to be faulty, but the AC in the room was so weak while the hallway and common room had wonderful, powerful AC. This means that it was so hot in the rooms that it was hard for me to sleep during my stay. I hope that this will be corrected because Madrid in the summer is HOT.

Didn't bother me too much but could be a big issue for others: the lockers under the bunk beds, because they are metal, make insane noise when opened/closed. Could really disturb those trying to get some rest.","Very friendly staff, amazing location, and comfortable, clean beds",7.0,August 2024,"August 13, 2024",Bed in 10-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,2,Solo traveler,8.5

Amazing except for the kids,"Kids! 

I know this is not really within their control and well, ‚Äúbusiness is business‚Äù (guests are guests). However, 
I‚Äôm a 30 year old female solo traveller and to my absolute surprise, about 70x 8-10 year old kids showed up/ checked into the hostel. They practically took over the place, Screeming and running around etc. 

On one of the nights, I was in the shower trying to juggle the shower turning off (3 second timer) whilst washing my hair. 2 minutes in, 15 screaming girls come into the bathroom for showers and start kicking the door and yelling at me. It got so intense, I gave up and got dressed with conditioner still in my hair to let them have at it..

Again, not the hostels fault but I guess I‚Äôd kinda like a heads up if I‚Äôm going to be attending a school trip..","In short, I Loved pretty much everything!

A great and comfortable hotel right in the vicinity of the good things of Madrid.,"Just remember to have some 5-euro cash on you for the key deposit. Also the bathroom uses this annoying press tap that turns off periodically, but that's not a major issue. Not much to dislike here!","I stayed here previously (under a different brand name) but was still very satisfied with the service and the facilities! The location is very central and fantastic, beds were comfy and with good privacy, and even towels were provided (which was amazing for a hostel), the staffs were friendly and helpful.

You get what you pay for,"It's a massive place so it's not really the kind of hostel where it is easy to meet new people. There are similarly not many places for you to sit to socialise with other people. As it is such a big place and there are so many people staying there at once, they don't seem to be able to check who is coming in and out. As a result, there was an issue in my room as the guy staying in the bed above me brought 2 girls back to the room at night. A member of staff only came up to deal with this incident after another girl in the room complained the following morning. Luckily, nothing happened but it does bring up questions about safety.",Great location as it is on Gran via and is close to loads of nice food places.

Would stay again,"Whilst they tried to keep on top of the cleaning some people managed to make it look like a tornado had run through the toilets and showers in no time, so could do with some checkups during the day but see why that would be hard to keep on top of. Might have been because there was a festival on when I was there so big festival crowd. Also some things were run down and needed fixing, nothing big more like a lose sink knob, bed curtain rail falling down, that type of thing. The showers were probably the worst thing, they were hard to get to a consistent heat and the pressure depended on each shower, but otherwise all good, and that were just minor annoyances.","The location was great. Near a bus to the airport, near the metro, almost in the middle of the centre, plenty of food places and shops etc. The staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was on for a good period (so great if you are an early or late riser), very basic but nice and easy for the price. Also had great breakfast cafes just around the corner.

nice hostel in centre,"the only thing that bothered me were the showers.

10/10,You have to leave the place when you are leaving Madrid:),"Location 10/10 - Located in the middle of Calle Gran Via, that is one of the best locations to stay in Madrid. You have a close access to metro station Gran Via, train station Sol, and bus station Sevilla/Sol. Also the place is located quite close to famous tourist attractions like Puerta del Sol, Plaza de Espa√±a and Plaza Mayor.
Staff 10/10 - They were so kind from the first moment to the last. They helped me with storing my luggage and whenever I had any problem they offered help with all their kindness. They also advised me a very delicious pizza store called Pizza Vesuvio- 10/10 recommendation.
Breakfast 7/10 - 6 euro per day, you are free to choose what you are gonna have. It‚Äôs just not my type of breakfast that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs 7/10. But you may like it - and also the lady working there was so kind. 
Price 10/10 - I found this place at minute and got the benefit of last minute deal. It was incredible to stay in a place like this in a city like Madrid just for ‚Ç¨13/night. Nowhere you can find a better place with the same conditions. 
Facilities 10/10 - The toilets/bathrooms were clean and the price was towel included which is something you cannot find in many places. They gave us the locker for only deposit which is also something other places may charge you for. 

In total, it was a very good experience from the beginning to the end and it is highly recommended. The best place to stay when you visit Madrid - 10/10!

"I can really recommend this hostel, I liked it.","The bunk beds were new and okay, but the handles or handrails on the upper bed could be a lot higher. The problem is that the mattress is so thick, which is great and comfy to sleep on, but does not go well with the rails. They just don't fit. The whole time I was scared to fall off the bed - and I did. I tried to grab the upper rails and handles, while climbing down the bed, but I missed one after taking a shower and also because I was tired, and I slipped and fell hard onto the concrete floor, landed right on my back. I was lucky. My feet felt tingly and I just had a concussion on my back, but I did get injured. I still cannot move at all without feeling the pain. Still, it could have been a lot worse after having such an accident... The second night I slept in the lower bunk. I was relieved and felt much more at ease.","The mattresses were high and comfy and clean, also the pillows and duvet... . The bathroom facilities were okay for a few nights.

Another point to note was that the rooms tended to get quite warm during my stay. It would be helpful if the hostel could address this issue by improving the ventilation or providing fans or air conditioning units to enhance the comfort of guests, especially during warmer months.

These improvements would greatly enhance the comfort and satisfaction of guests staying at the hostel.","I recently had the opportunity to stay at Gran V√≠a Hostel in Madrid, and while my overall experience was good, there were a few areas that could benefit from improvement.

Of course there was no party but just extremely noisy guests.

However, here, no mirrors in room, but only two small mirrors in bathroom in front of sinks (one bathroom for the entire floor), bathroom counters were often left very dirty (makeup, used tissues/towels, etc). Mirrors usually wouldn't be an issue, but with so many people using the bathroom, you couldn't even brush your teeth or wash your face without feeling like people were breathing down your neck. 4 sinks, only 2 with mirrors, and there were times when I would walk in and there would be 6-8 people trying to squeeze in to the counter space with mirrors.

"Great location, great staff","There is a 50-50 chance you‚Äôll have cold water in the shower. On my last day (I rebooked 2 extras days in female dorm), I went around testing the water before getting in to find one with hot water.  

If you‚Äôre sensitive to noise, you‚Äôll need earplugs. The benefit of being in a central location also means that city noise could keep you awake.

The bunk beds are ridiculously low, it‚Äôs as if they used the specs fir children‚Äôs bunks. Normally I prefer a lower bunk but if you are tall, see if you can get a top bunk, save your neck.","The staff at this hostel are really great, friendly, professional and very helpful.
The location is fantastic and the beds are comfortable. The bathrooms are reasonably clean given the number of guests.

The common room/dining area is large with many tables and chairs. It‚Äôs good to have a place to relax (or work or make calls) other than your room.

They have a breakfast for 4.50 euros with a fair selection. I‚Äôm gluten intolerant and was able to have ham slices, cheese, yogurt, fruit and a sort of chocolate rice krispies cereal (if Kelloggs, it probably does contain gluten but I took a chance and did not react).

"Excellent location and staff, but could use some improvements","I was allocated a lower bunk, which turned out to be a uniquely uncomfortable experience, because the bottom of the top bunk was too low. I couldn't sit up without banging my head against the top bunk. And I'm not even unusually tall (just 1.6 meters), so taller individuals may find this an even bigger problem. So in theory, while I had a private space for reading or using the computer in bed, having to crouch all the time made it too difficult to actually do these things.

There are no hooks in the room to allow you to hang your clothes. I would have preferred to let my clothes dry in the air rather than fold them in the locker, given the hot weather in Madrid and how sweat-drenched you can become.

A chair (or stool) or two also would have made the room more comfortable, so you don't have to sit on the floor or on the bed in your outside clothes if you don't want to. Anyway, the problem with the lower bunk that I mention above makes sitting in your bed impossible.

The common room was uncomfortably warm. I'm not sure if it was because the air-conditioning was switched off or just not working. Between the very cramped lower bunk and the very hot common room, I didn't have a great time trying to read or use my computer at the hostel.","The hostel has an excellent location along one of the main roads in Madrid, the Gran Via, with many places to eat and drink.

When you arrive, you find your covers, pillow and towel in the same drawer under the bed where someone else has just kept their dirty luggage; I found this extremely unclean and unnecessary. Why don‚Äôt they keep them over the clean sheets instead of the place that has just been touched by suitcase wheels that have been all over the city?
The shower stops running every 60s or so, you have to keep pressing it again and again during your shower to keep the water coming, which is unnecessarily annoying.","The receptionists were very friendly and helpful. 
The hostel provides towels and a padlock and can store your luggage at no additional cost before check in time. 
The heating keeps the room at a good temperature during the night, the covers are comfy and the mattress is good.

The bunk beds were not very comfortable, especially the upper one where I slept. I hurt my feet every time I went up, and always thought I'd fall and hurt myself while going down because the stairs are awful.

the floor itself has a frame with 10 rules guests need to obey, which I will include a photo, saying as well that there are cameras and mics available. so they did not see the chaos in the cameras? I am sure if it was an individual causing all this chaos or had not followed a rule from the ones hostel mentions,  it would have been an issue.

When you shower, the water immediately wets the whole floor and there's maybe 1 meter of space separating your bed from the shower. I got my entire suitcase wet just by using my ""private"" shower. After that, I used the communal bathrooms, but having paid a premium for my own bathroom, this wasn't ideal.

Also, Madrid was in a heat wave when I visited. There was no air conditioner. I was dying of sweat. I literally had to sleep with no blankets on just to survive the heat and it was the most miserable sleep I've had in months. Why advertise this as a 2-star hotel when there's no air conditioner at all? I've been to roach motels with air conditioners.

A lot of private room hostels are run like hotels. This one is unfortunately not that. It's a hostel experience, with near hotel prices.","The location was fantastic in the heart of Madrid on Gran Via, in the center of everything.

I arrived at 12 am and they told me that a child pay as an adult but can't be in shared room, it means that they are adults when they want. The app allow the booking but I must pay other ultra expensive hotel for him and my mom, but they did the check in for all of us. I thought that I had read bad but this night the hostel receive 2 same cases (children about 17 years old) and they were not welcome here at 1 am, poor guys.","The zone, the location.",1.0,June 2022,"June 6, 2022",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,3,Family,8.5
Pleasant,"1. Bathroom situation is all around bad there. 
- There is one large bathroom for each gender (with about 6 toilets and showers each I believe, and one small bathroom (with 2 of each). That's it, for all the guests. And with that ratio... It should be no surprise that things got really nasty, really quickly. 
- The showers had literally no place to put things except one hanger (which would get some water spray, so you'd want to cover your stuff with your towel) inside, and a tiny spot for soap. 
- And worst of all... The showers had a water timer (which is fine! Environmentally friendly and reasonable at a hostel) - but, it was set for 5-6 seconds. Literally, I counted. So every 5 seconds, you have to push it down, or your water would cut off. Now I'm a quick shower-er (especially at hostels)... But this is not normal. 
2. The beds/bedrooms are quite minimal & small even in comparison to other hostels, with no hangers whatsoever and only a teen shelf for example.","Pros: 
- If you're using this as a one-night stop-over, it's a great location. Location is 20min walk to Atoche (train station) & 5 mins walk to where the rapid bus to the airport stops. And if you want to go out in the Gran Via area, sure it's the right spot. 
- The workers are good. Front desk staff are efficient and nice. When I came, my bed and bedsheets had some hairs on them - and the front desk had a cleaning lady come by immediately to replace them.",6.0,May 2022,"June 1, 2022",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,1,Solo traveler,8.5

So I just arrived back to Europe from my 3 months travel around Latinam√©rica and i arrived to the hostel around 1o 'clock, i get in the hostel and the receptionist telling me the check in is at 3 pm on a way like i should know this and why i am here.... So after i could not sleep on my 9 hours of night flight i asked this guy can i drop my heavy bags here because IF I DONT ASK HIM HE WOULD NOT OFFER IT. It was very sad to arrive back to this to Europe I was volunteering as a receptionist in other countries and i was always happy and kind with the guests.
