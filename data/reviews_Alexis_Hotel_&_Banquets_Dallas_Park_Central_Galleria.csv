It matches the price for the stay.,No breakfast.,"The price is right and the hotel is clean, quiet and mostly filled with people who work. People may hang around to ‚Äúsmoke‚Äù because it is a smoke free property but other than that, this is a place to stay when you are transitioning into your own space. Maybe sort of like an extended stay. Mostly families here so I wouldn‚Äôt stay here for fun only for necessity.",9.0,June 2024,"June 21, 2024",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,1,Family,7.5

"My stayed was very good, staff was very helpful and kind. The location is next to in and out so that‚Äôs very cool. WiFi i","The bathroom curtain doesn‚Äôt prevent water from going out when showering, all of the gym equipment needs to be replace with the exception of the bicep curl.

Satisfactory.,"It was fine.  You might want to reconsider the lighting.  Those super-white (almost fluorescent) bulbs are hard on the mind  and eyes (especially at night - Yeow!) - perhaps some 'soft white' bulbs?  You might like to include somewhere (maybe on your desk(s), a writing pad perhaps, a pencil - In case someone might like to jot something down?  And, also somewhere to print something out from one's computer.  You asked!","Everything was very nice - soft pillows, clean sheets.  The In and Out place next door came in so handy!",8.0,April 2024,"April 30, 2024",King Room - Disability Access,2,Solo traveler,7.5
"Quick business trip and meetup with friends, good place for price","Small TV in the room, where did they even find a 30"" TV to put in the room?? No seating around pool. Parking could be an issue during an event or busy travel season. No breakfast in hotel.","Location was fine, 20 minute drive to Irving for business meeting, 20 minute drive to Toyota Music Factory for fun. Room was spacious, clean, TV was small, like 30"" so it was hard to view and hear clearly. Pool was ok, they need more seating. Only 1 chaise lounge and 1 table with 3 chairs. Wi-Fi could be better. Fast food places nearby, donut shop around the corner, beer and wine in same plaza.

Alexis hotel meets most basic needs in a quality way.,"I wish I had a flatter pillow to sleep on and the WiFi was rather slow. Also, the shower needs a longer curtain (or move the rod) because it was tricky not to get water on the floor.",I really appreciated the quality of our rooms for the price that we paid. Everything was clean and professional and the Staff were helpful. They accommodated our need for extra towels but weren't able to deliver them to our room.

Super clean Great price Worth the Money,The only thing I did not like was the plumbing lol I thought the toilet was gonna overflow each time I flushed it.

Lol otherwise there was nothing else that was dis-likable.,"This was a great hotel experience with great price value. I was absolutely surprised at how cheap this was for a King room for 3 nights.

Compatible beautiful place for stay.,"Nothing but i couldn't get a spoon so they gave me a disposable knife and fork though and a paper little bowl. Better than nothing.üòä  for M√ºsli or flakes. It could be better to put a reusable glass cups and spoon  by the kings room than the disposable . Rubber / plastik cups of 2sets. I Really don't like  those for hot drinks. it is uneconomical and unhealthy. Also not presentable . Add value there. Thanks üëçüèª
You can save cost though with many changes and for better. Also for  an hour early check in, to pay money is not so  ok but it's choice.
.My point of view anyways. But was considerate for an hour late checkout üòÉ","For the building,it's simple and clean.
 it's a combined  taste of renewned old and looks good and unique in its own way, it's spacious and a nice self service of tea or coffee machine in the room. The AC is wow I am so impressed and all the various channel is a good one for a bite without any extra charges . Job well done üëçüèª .I like the pool  and the portable sport center inside the building to keep you active and the garden aisle where you can just take a breath of fresh air or read. It's with table and chair. Also the Eis machine on each floor is an extra to taste üòÇ maybe for me coming from Europe probably.butbits a good one .üëçüèªüòÉ
Though you could leave your bag before check in time is a plus mark . Like that too.

Spring Break Disaster,"I recently had a 4 day, 3 night stay here. It was hard to go to sleep the first 2 nights due to the guests above me keeping up a lot of noise. They also had me up at 6am due to the same noise. I called and complained to the front desk staff and they stated they would call them. However, the noise intensified. 

I requested new towels from the housekeeper early morning (8am) and she stated I had to ask someone else for some reason. I called downstairs to request more towels and garbage bags and never had them delivered to me. As I was headed out a couple hours later, I stopped at the front desk and mentioned me still waiting on more towels and garbage bags. Her response was ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm just getting here (at 5pm) but here you go.‚Äù 

My final night there, I was awaken out of my sleep at 11pm by a police officer stating we were being kicked out because my kids were causing a disturbance. No prior phone call or anything as they did with the guests that were disturbing me. As expected, they lied like we damaged the room (the same room they gave me garbage bags for that I used to store trash as I packed our belongings prior to laying down to go to sleep) to avoid giving us our deposit back. After only getting 1 hour of sleep prior to being awaken by the officer, I was forced to basically make a 7 hour drive back home after midnight off of 1 hour of sleep.","Location was central point to all of the attractions we  visited.. 20-25 minutes away from Six Flags, Andretti‚Äôs Karting and Epic Waters.
