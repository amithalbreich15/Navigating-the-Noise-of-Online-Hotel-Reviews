great location hotel,"The shower has transparent glass with 1 side for curtain, but it is preferable to have it frosted for privacy. The room is compact and suitable for accommodating only 1-2 large luggage bags at most. Breakfast begins at 7:30 AM, and guests with early flights or tours may find it challenging to allocate time for it. While the food options are not extensive, they are sufficient in quality. i suggest the hotel to go for renovations in a few years time as I believe the carpets are showing signs of aging.","The location is excellent, close to Myeongdong Metro and the Myeongdong Night Market.",9.0,December 2023,"December 15, 2023",Standard Twin Room,5,Family,7.8

Great location and value for money but construction next door is extremely loud starting from 6-8am.,"Construction right next door starts around 6-8am depending on the day, extremely noisy due to the construction (banging, excavating etc), only an issue if you are looking to sleep in and not up by 8am for your day.

This seems to have only just started so will probably be the case for the next 6 months + for sure (or beyond).

Brilliantly located budget stay,"The bathroom was glass panelled, which on the side could be covered by a blind but was still exposed in the doorway in front of the mirror. This wouldn't be too much of an issue for a couple, but for a mother-daughter stay, was a little too intimate for our liking!","The hotel was very well situated a short walk from Seoul Tower, the nearest Metro station and the bustling main part of Myeong-dong; bursting with shops, restaurants and street food. The room was clean and a decent size with comfy beds.

Great hotel on a hill close to Myeongdong night market,"Having the toilet in a separate cubicle away from the sink and shower was not comfortable.

The rooftop bar closes at 10 pm. The receptionist said the last order is at 9.30 pm, so we rushed to go up before then, but when we got up, the staff there told us it's actually 9 pm and refused to bring us drinks at 9.25pm. All the cushions had also been removed, so we couldn't sit there.

The hotel is not directly at Myeongdong, so you have to walk for about 7 minutes to reach the Myeongdong walking street and night market. 

The hotel itself is located on a hill, so walking up there at night can get a bit annoying, though it's perfectly doable for everyone.

If you miss the last train and get back by bus, the walk from the nearest bus stop is a little intimidating, as the area is super quiet at night - though nothing happened, but there's just no one around.","The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, there was a safe, and the AC worked great. The toilet was japanese-style.

The rooftop bar had really good views of Namsan Tower.

The Myeongdong walking street and night market, as well as the airport limousine bus stop, are within a 7-minute downhill walk.

The receptionists were very helpful during check-in, allowed to pay in cash, helped with storing my luggage, and advising on the airport limousine bus practical info.",8.0,October 2023,"October 8, 2023",Standard Double Room,2,Family,7.8

Good but affected by very close construction works,"There’s construction next to the property which looks like it’ll be around for a long while. Although the hotel gave us earplugs, it really didn’t cover up the sound of the construction at all. Luckily the majority of our stay was on a Korean National holiday (meaning the construction only happened one night) but it really did mess up our sleep.

Also thank you to the cleaning lady that i saw most of the time, she was really nice to me. I just wanted to point out the fact that the last day i stayed here, when i left the hotel and came back (after an electrical check of 2 hours), the door of my room was open. Maybe it was because i would not have been able to open it with the card, but i don't know and anybody could have enter my room. I don't think the other bedrooms' doors were open. And i wanted to add that the wifi was working really well, i've never seen that in any other hotel before even if i don't travel everyday, and it doesn't require any information to use it, simply connect to it !

Overall ok,"The noise, is some construction going on in the area around the hotel which we basically barely slept. 

The first two nights we didn’t sleep until we asked for a room change which the staff was happy to do so change it. The lower floors were a bit better but still very noisy. 

For longer stays that a few days the place is a bit small especially if travelling with luggage’s.","The staff, if it was not for the staff i would give a overall lower review. But all the staff we spoke with during a 10 nights stay was amazing and happy to help. 

Also we been offered to leave the luggage’s 5 days before our stay as we went on a road trip which was a very big help. 

Also location was just a few minutes walk to the biggest shopping area but also was located between 3 different subway lines within minutes walk. 

3-4 min to blue line

But while Myeongdong shopping area might get too crowded and loud at times, the area near the hotel is pretty chill.

Great Location and comfortable bed..but a bit overpriced for what you get,"The not so good things: 
Room walls were peeling off. 
The toilet had a permanent odor which was a bit unpleasant. 
The bathroom was so compact it was quite hard to towel dry inside.  I did like the quirkiness of it but it was not that practical. 
Overall feel of the room was that it needed some TLC. Cleaning was ok (2nd day better than the first) 
Although they give you 2 small.bottles of water per day there is no water dispenser in the entire hotel. Of course you can go buy for the shop but being used to free water at every other hotel we stayed and even restaurants it was a bit dissapointing. 

Breakfast: 
With views from the 21st floor the space was nice but also in need of some TLC. Some chairs were so run down. 
Food was mediocre. None of the hot plates actually kept the food hot. The only hot dish i had were the fried eggs cooked on the spot by the chef. 
Although the food was comestible haha the usual price - if not in the room rate - is 24000won per person so def not worth it. 

They do have gym - 2 treadmills and 1 bike and some bumbells - my boyfriend did makr use of it, but not spacious enough if let's say you want to do some yoga or stretches. 

For Sauna and the Pool - you need to pay extra 50000 won so we did not feel encouraged to try to use them. 

Overall the most disatisfying experience was with Ibis and it was for sure not the cheapest hotel we stayed in.","This review comes as comparison with 3 other hotels we stayed in Korea and Ibis comes last. 
Was unexpected as i had high hopes knowing the chain but experoencing others hotels i'd say Ibis lacks the most the korean hospitality. 

I give them props for having good customer service when an issue arrised at Check in with our room. 
The good things: 
Location! Can't find any fault here. Plus the hotel is super close to the Airport Limousine station which came in handy in the early morning of our Check out. 

Room is very spacious  we had no issues having our 2 suitcases open ± the room actually has a small clothes rail with some hangers. 

View is great as well overlooking thr myeongdone area and Namsan tower. 

Quirky layout with transparent windows to the bathroom - they do have opaque windows for the shower part and even a pull up curtain if needed. Toilet is separate 

They do have a rooftop bar (which we did not get the chance to see because oh well we are in myeondon after all and with easy accese to the trendier areas (itaewon and Heunde) 

Laundry services are available at extra charge of 5000won (same price for dryer)(a bit on the pricey side)",6.0,September 2023,"September 12, 2023",Standard Double Room,4,Family,7.8

Good budget hotel but if you can afford somewhere else stay somewhere else,"Cons:
-Breakfast is pricey for quality and variety 
Bathroom is very small 
-Towels smelled strongly of presumably vinegar for most of our stay
-Shower stall door did not close fully as did the wall window making the room noisy
-The AC did not work our first night making it difficult to sleep but this issue was fixed when mentioned to staff
-Unable to sit in the restaurant or the rooftop restaurant without ordering 
-Shower sealant was moldy 
-Smaller room than I'm used to with the beds very close together
-The laundry facilities was only a single washer and dryer in the basement level that was meant for the whole hotel to use meaning we often would have to wait for it to become free or sometimes our clothes were taken out when left too long
-PS. Don't get it confused with the other Ibis hotel that is a few blocks away because they will not help you get to the correct hotel even when it's raining and the only difference in the name is the word Styles","Pros:
-English speaking staff for the most part and wonderfully accommadating and understanding 
-Laundry facilities to do your own clothes
-Replenished all towels daily

Fair - wouldn't stay again though,"Apart from the location, I did not enjoy anything. The staff aren't interested at all, I work in a hotel myself and I requested a quiet room and asked for a spacious room as me and my sister were travelling with a lot of luaggage. I booked this a few months in advance so I don't see any excuse as to why I couldn't have been given a room with a little more space to store our luggage, thats all I needed.

I would not fall for the pictures  online as you'd  think the rooms are big and spacious , the rooms are tiny. We booked a twin room and had no space for our luaggage  and  we'd  have to keep our suitcases  on our bed. 

We checked in and 2 minutes later  I found  myself at the front desk asking if they could give me a bigger room in  the same category I didnt even look for an upgrade just a bit bigger room  to which the receptionist said ""sorry all our rooms are the same size"" they didn't  even show any interest in problem solving.

There is no vegetarian  breakfast options available , I wouldn't  blame the hotel as finding  vegetarian food is an issue  across the city however  a bit of english would have been nice  to be able to communicate  our dietary requirements.

I would  recommend to book a better hotel outside the city centre as all the hotels in myeongdong  have tiny rooms  The city has great connectivity  through metro so I'd recommend to book in another area as all the touristic spots are easily accessible by metro.","The location  is perfect just a couple of minutes  walk from the myeongdong station exit 7, 10, 1.

Great location and value for money (advance booking).,"I didn't appreciate the staff's hospitality, which I believe was due to the language barrier.
They were more likely to try to end the conversation if they felt they couldn't provide you with any more information in English, but not all of them, I suppose.
I was speaking with the senior staff (I believe), and he was able to arrange the transfer to the airport as well as answer my questions. 

The hotel did not have public water, but it was available for purchase for KWR1000 per bottle.
One morning, the convenience store located directly in front of the hotel, which claimed to be open 24 hours a day, was closed, and one of the employees was gracious enough to give it to me for free, despite the fact that he claimed I should have paid for it. well!  I sincerely thank this gentleman. 

Unlike the other hotel, the hotel did not have an iron in each room.","The location is excellent, as you can walk to Myeongdong Market in a matter of minutes.
Restaurants close around 8:00 p.m., but one restaurant is open until 01:00-02:00 a.m. and is located just outside the hotel.

The hotel also provided free laundry (self-service) for guests who had limited clothing and wanted it washed.
The disadvantage is that they only have one washing machine and one dryer.

The room size was adequate for the price, and I had not expected anything more.

Would have been nice if the spa was useable on the basis you have to reserve it, if covid is the concern. Seems very odd when the gym is available though.

On top of that, if you were not meeting my expectations, you do not have the right to display impatience. I would be the one upset.

Not worth a single dollar.  I’ve stayed at roadside roach motels that were better.,"The bathroom situation is not great, the grouts got mold spots and somehow the shower had a hair from the last occupants stuck on the ceiling.

Also the vents between the rooms seem to be connected.  They did nothing to stop the other visitors from smoking which irritated my wifes’ throat for the stay even though I complained a few times. 

Not to mention the entire building smells like POO when it rains heavily. As far as I know, no lodging should ever smell like fecal matter.  And I’ve stayed in Hotels in Morocco with open sewage right next to the streets that smelled far far nicer.

Lastly they called a cab for us to take to the airport which the driver tried to pull the ol’ switch to an unmarked vehicle because this taxi is broken scam. I had to pay the guy 10000 won to get him to f**k right off.  

Here is the kicker, I called the concierge to see if they were willing to make it right.  They flat out refused.

The room overall wasnt very clean to start with, with stains and dust everywhere.  The room is really outdated, the bathroom and toilet is separate and the sink and shower area is a cheap plastic design. Considering how much they charge I think it is well overpriced and having stayed in many hotels in Seoul this is definitely well below the standard for the price point they charge. To add to the state of the room, there seems to be little soundproofing between the rooms, we could hear the next rooms TV pretty well. Lukily our neighbours decided not to watch the TV all night or we would have struggled.
