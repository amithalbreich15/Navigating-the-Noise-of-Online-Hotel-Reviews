Wonderful,"I hated the way the lights in the bathroom and shower went on and off constantly with their motion detectors.  If I turned over in my bed in the middle of the night, the lights would come on.  Similarly, if I didn't move enough in both the shower and toilet, the lights would go off.

Hotel Central - The clue is in the title. Go there - they have cake!,"Unusually for a 4-star hotel, there was no kettle in our room. To fix this, the hotel staff were helpful - every day they gave us a large thermos flask of hot water and allowed us to take a cup from the cafe. In the morning we would return them.
Our bathroom needed some maintenance - the sink had a small leak from the mixer tap internals which dripped onto the floor; the shower door could slam into the wall and potentially shatter. Fixable stuff. Though it wasn't a problem for us, the nearby clock may annoy some late risers in the morning.","Hotel Central is in an excellent location, as the name suggests. From the airport, the F line bus drops you off at the far end of Anichstraße where it meets the pedestrianised Maria-Theresien-Straße. From here you have an 8 minute walk via the Sparkassenplatz shopping square, accessed via a colourful illuminated tunnel. You will see the famous Cafe Central ahead. Upon arrival, all the reception staff are friendly, speaking German and English at least. It's minutes away from the tourist office and all the bus and tram lines you'll ever need.
It's a nice hotel with some quirks - their sauna must be requested in advance; the bar was never open; the cafe is so popular that reservations are recommended (in the morning buffet breakfasts are served here, while later in the day it serves great coffee and cake in style, like an intellectual speakeasy). There are lifts, a luggage room and a ski/bicycle storage room. There is an underground carpark. Beds are comfortable and the place is clean. In the morning, a nearby clock starts its chimes on the hour from 7am which we found useful. The free ski bus to the Stubai Glacier departs outside the hotel on certain days. 
Put simply, I would stay there again.",9.0,March 2022,"March 15, 2022",Standard Double Room,6,Group,8.1

Top notch,,"The hotel was lovely with a beautiful atmosphere. The bedroom was pretty with the Alpine wood and a fairly basic but comfortable bed, fan, TV (although I didn’t use that myself) and lots of space. The one thing I was caught out by was that there was no kettle/tea in the room, so I had to buy one. I believe this is commonplace in Austria (I had colleagues who found the same in other hotels) but, coming from the UK where it is not, I was unprepared.

The bathroom was fantastic: a great bath, which was very comfortable with plenty of room to relax in.

The breakfast was very nice with good variety, and the Café Central was definitely a highlight of the stay. I also highly recommend the infrared sauna and fitness room, if you’re that way inclined: the fitness room is fairly basic but has a weights section as well as cardio equipment, which is great, and I wish I could’ve taken the infrared sauna home!

The best thing about the hotel, though, was the staff, all of whom were exceptionally helpful and kind. I will be coming to Innsbruck in the future, so will definitely stay here again too.",9.0,August 2021,"August 30, 2021",Superior Double Room,13,Solo traveler,8.1

Good,,"We recently stayed at Hotel Central in Innsbruck and had a rather disappointing experience. The only positive aspect of our stay was the hotel's excellent location, which is conveniently close to the central area and the river.

Unfortunately, the rest of our stay did not meet our expectations for a four-star hotel. The rooms lacked air conditioning, and we were provided with only a standalone fan. This made the room uncomfortably hot, leading to poor sleep quality.

The bathroom was another point of contention. It was quite small, particularly the space between the basin and the toilet, which felt very cramped.

Additionally, we encountered an issue with the room's safe box. When we attempted to access our passports and money, the safe wouldn't open. We contacted the reception desk, but the receptionist was unhelpful and rude. He initially told us that we would have to wait until the next day, citing a holiday, which was unacceptable since all our valuables were inside the safe. After a prolonged argument, he finally said he would send someone to our room. We waited for 20 minutes before a very polite gentleman arrived and opened the safe within two minutes.

To add to our frustration, the internet was not working during our stay due to an internal problem in the hotel.

I am typically the kind of traveler who tries to minimize criticism and tolerate regular shortcomings that are beyond the hotel's control, especially since my wife and I are retired and travel frequently throughout the year. However, our stay at this hotel was a combination of frustrations that caused us significant emotional and physical discomfort.

Overall, our experience at Hotel Central was far from satisfactory. The lack of air conditioning, the small bathroom, the poor service from one of the reception staff, and the internet outage made our stay quite uncomfortable. We had higher expectations for a four-star hotel and were disappointed with the level of service provided.",7.0,May 2024,"May 23, 2024",Standard Twin Room,2,Couple,8.1

Nice oldschool hotel in the middle of the city center,"- There are just 2 lifts of which one was broken during half of our stay. It seems like the cleaning staff doesn’t have a service elevator, so we had to wait a lot for the lift that many times we decided to walk up/down 4 floors
- Room is a bit outdated
- Paid water bottles in the fridge (3 euros) is so 1990’s, at the checkout they wanted to give us 2 water bottles, but that makes no sense as you can’t take it past airport security
- Heating was turned to sauna mode most of our stay
- While the big hotel keys certainly have their charm, it is outdated and may be better replaced by a card system","- Location is right in the center

We went back up to the room and shortly after one of the cleaning staff’s came. We left the room so that he/she could work in peace. When we came back to the room it look all good until we laid down.

"Horrible staff if you encounter a problem - a meteor could strike at any time, apparently!!","Very poor customer service by hotel ""manager"". Carolla refused to listen to our complaint about the room flooding when I took a shower. Told us that we should have left it for the staff (who were unavailable to help at the time) which would have caused further water damage to the room and all our belongings. Kept saying a ""10% refund"" was all they could give us. It was a very stressful experience trying to mop up all of the water and ruined our time in Innsbruck - we were only staying for one day, so this was our only evening to enjoy the town. Yes, mishaps do happen but this was more than a mishap and the conversation/argument which ensued the following morning at checkout, left a very bad taste which is a shame. I tried to explain how customer service works, she told me not to ""make this personal!"" and that a ""meteor could hit the whole hotel and cause widespread damage!"" I think all I could do was laugh at her at this point. The TV in the room also did not work. Although the breakfast offered a good selection, the nice pastries which we could see others were enjoying, were not replenished despite us asking politely and with still an hour and a half of breakfast time left (this was also before the argument with Carolla at the front desk). My mum was with me at the time and she said we should have taken photos of how awful the flooding was - my instinct was to mop it all up asap, never imagining the staff could be so unreasonable and ungrateful. Shame I didn't take photos though as I would have happily shared them with this review.",Nice location. Good selection at breakfast if you get there early enough.

Also I had to shower in the bathtub because there's no independent shower. But the height of the shower was so low that I had a hard time finding the right posture. I knelt, I crouched, and in the end I sat on the edge of the bathtub in order to finish the shower.

Ideally we would have been moved to a new room but the hotel was full, so it was suggested that we go for a walk while the room was cleaned. Bit disappointing that little apology was given, or nothing offered e.g. a free drink at the bar etc. The staff did thoroughly clean the room and provide fresh bedding while we waited.

The room (standard double) was OK for a one night stay, but was very warm unless you kept the fan on and the window open (but then it is a bit noisy).

If I was alone, I could easily sleep in both beds and it would be ok, but since we were two persons, I had to pay an extra 20 euros/night to use the second bed? It makes no sense whatsoever.

Ah yes, and how can we forget, we had no cable for one night, making our room feel like we were in the year 1940. The answer from the receptionist was: ""it was only for one night"". 

Even after explaining that they did not provide 4 star conditions, and the room was grossly overpriced, there was no way to make the receptionist understand our problem and concern. We, however, got a discount of 10 euros!! thank God :)

The only reason this hotel has 4 stars is that they fit in a sauna and a gym at the 4th floor. The room was far from what a 4 star hotel should have. Wildly overpriced.
