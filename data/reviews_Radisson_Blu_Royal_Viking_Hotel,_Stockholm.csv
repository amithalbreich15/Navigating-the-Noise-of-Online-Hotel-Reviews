Excellent hotel in the heart of Stockholm - contemporary with brilliant facilities.,"Soundproofing! I had one of the premium rooms on the 9th floor but unfortunately this was next to a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù door, which I assume was for hotel staff. On Friday night especially, I struggled to sleep due to constant noise adjacent to my room, repeated slamming of this door and a lot of shouting and laughing, which was disruptive and didn‚Äôt appear to be coming from hotel guests. The bed was comfy but the activity and noise from people using this door really needs to be reviewed by the hotel management. I would come back again as there were lots of great aspects to this hotel, but I would ask for a different room.","Amazing location - literally right next to Stockholm central station, which made my trip to stockholmsmassen for a conference very smooth!

4 stars hotel in a superb location but that needs better organization,"the location of breakfast buffet is not great, if you're sitting on the other corner of the room, it's a bit far to come and go to a buffet.
we requested for an extra bed for our kid that was not present in our arrival because we arrived earlier than checkin time, but when we reported it, they put it in the bedroom without mounting. I couldn't find enough space to open it and I didn't know how to do it, I had to request for help. After the extra bed was opened, there wasn't much room and we couldn't even use the armchair anymore, we were expecting more space in the room. 
When booking, it specified you could use the gym and swimming pool, but at our arrival it was said it was an extra (and not cheap at all!), luckily we were offered to use these facilities for all our stay. 
There was one set of towels missing, since we were 3 in the room, when they gave us what was missing, one was still incomplete and we had to go to the reception again, having to wait a long time on the line.

Hotel is located in the city near everything, few minutes from arlanda express, approx 20 mins door to door from the airport. 1 minute walk from T Centralen station. 

Morden and clean room, I've seen others comment on rooms being small, I think they are fairly standard size.

Perfect for tourists and short visits,"My only dislike was the size of the room and bathroom. We felt a bit cramped in there with our suitcases open. We had to unpack and pack frequently so that we could move around in the room. While the bathroom had everything we needed, the shower/bathtub was quite compact. It was difficult to get in and out of it, and the bathtub's curvature made things even more precarious. So I felt a bit confined and sometimes afraid that I'd slip (even with handle bars attached). But we were only there for 3 days so it didn't bother us too much. And this may not be a problem for everyone. Honestly, we were very happy with the room overall.","The location was perfect! It was in the middle of all the bustle with many restaurants, shops, convenience stores, and system bolagets (liquor store) around. All the major attractions were also close by (e.g., Vasa museum).

Very Good,"When we checked in we had to use a card to authorise the payment and they told us the money will not leave the account until we checked out. On our card the money was taken out twice which meant all our money saved was gone. We brought this up with the hotel a number of times and they said the money is only pending and only one payment was taken out. We had to contact our bank ASAP! Advice if you are staying, make sure you use a card that your bank will protect your money and get a refund for you, as we only want to pay once of our stay not twice!!!!","Hotel was very clean. Our room was small but very comfortable. 
The bar downstairs was nice to have a relaxing drink during the day and a lively drink in the evening. They had a dj on Friday and Saturday evenings/night. Only thing was two of the bar men were not friendly and would not entertain me as I didn't speak Swedish. 
The cocktail bar on the 9th floor was amazing. We enjoyed a number of drinks there Saturday. 
We got our breakfast in the hotel on Sunday morning and instantly regretted not getting it on Saturday morning. I would highly recommend getting the breakfast in the hotel.

Lovely romantic weekend in central Stockholm for a good price,"The description on booking.com only mentioned a big doublebed without any dimensions. My guess is that the bed was 160 cm which I would say is a normal size for a doublebed and not particulary big. 
All times for the pool were already booked for Saturday and Sunday when we arrived shortly after check-in started. It would have been nice to be made aware of if it was possible to book time at the pool befor check-in. 
The plug to the bathtube was missing, so we could not use the bathtub.","The hotel is right next to central station which is a perfect location. We booked a double room but received a junior suite which was much appreciated as we were 3 persons. Although we initially only received 2 towels, the personnel was quick to correct the error. The room was very lovely with comfortable chairs, sofa and bed. The room faced the inner garden and was very quite with a good view over the breakfast area which made it easy to plan a good time for breakfast. The breakfast was delicious and had a lot of variety. It was also very positive that coffee refill was brought directly to the table during breakfast. Quite late check-out at 12pm which guaranteed a relaxed start into the day.

Generally good,"Booking.com said breakfast was 299 sek but i was charged 350 sek. The girl at the desk said booking.com states that the 299 sek is only if you book through them. I checked and it wasn't the case so I'm not happy about that. The room was lovely but had very little natural light. I couldn't always keep the curtains open because the window was overlooked by the other rooms in the courtyard. Even when open it was still dark so the lights were always on. The bathroom had plumbing issues that persisted even after the plumber came by. Whenever people left their rooms the doors automatically closed so hard that my entire room, including the bed, shook. So it's not great if you want to sleep in a bit longer. If you don't hang the ""do not disturb"" sign outside, the cleaners will keep banging on the door in the morning until you answer. There was a power cut on the morning of my departure, so I had to have a shower and prepare in complete darkness. With some things like the plumbing and the power cut I was maybe just unlucky. I would still recommend this hotel.","5 stars for the front desk staff who were always friendly and helpful. I was also given an early check-in, which I am grateful for. 5 stars for the location. 5 stars for the hotel itself, which is huge and very well presented. The room was as modern as the rest of the hotel and very comfortable. On the whole, it's a lovely hotel that's central to everything.

"Apart from the sleep problem it was, as usual, very pleasant.","The location of my room, 825, right under the Sky Bar! The first three nights I managed to sleep ok, because the noise level was more or less ok, but the night between Saturday and Sunday the noise was unbearable and it was not until the bar closed at 1 a.m that it was possible to try and sleep! I really don't understand why, in a bar, where people presumably want to talk, the sound (won't call it music since I mostly herad the base...) level has to be so high that people have to shout to understand one another. In a disco, ok, ut not in a hotel bar! 
That was my complaint, but unfortunately it affacted how I felt when I left yesterday! I did talk to several people at the reception, including Anders, and they were very friendly and understood the problem.

For a short (2 night) stay it was chosen for the location and comfort and it was perfectly fine.,"The room we got was almost Japanese in size: there was only space for one suitcase on the suitcase-rack - but once one bag was there was no space left at the end of the bed. The two of us were continuing up north and with our ski-equipment it was a bit of a puzzle maneuvering around the tiny room. 
The ventilation was VERY noisy. 
The one in the actual room you could switch off, but since the windows could not be opened it got a bit claustrophobic. The ventilation in the bathroom could not be switched off and if the bathroom door wasn't properly closed it was white-noise torture.
The atrium is under renovation so and was quite dark and sad - but that will be sorted when it's all over I suppose.
I'm not a big fan of these open space lobby areas where the check-in desk, lounge area and bar is pretty much all one. 
I know I'm getting old but the sound level of the music in the bar was also way to loud and it spills over to all the other areas. 
There are few places to escape to with a drink if you just want to talk to someone without noise-pollution. 
We were chased out by the security guy from the room with a big table facing Vasagatan because it was reserved for companies (?)- but there was no-one in there and no sign on the open door saying we could not enter... 
I suggest you create a room for companies in the back somewhere and use this space as a chill-out area for people whom want a drink in a calm corner watching people walk by.","The location is PERFECT if you come and go to and from Arlanda, the main airport. Arlanda Express is a brilliant service.

The hotel bar/restaurant seemed busy and looked to be very good based on the menu. Rooms were comfortable and the bathrooms featured modern fully tiled walk in showers and lovely heated floors.

"Superb location, comfortable beds, friendly staff","Shower - the pressure was terrible, so we had to change the stream to 5 smaller ones on the middle to get some, instead of the usual version. It was weird and uncomfortable to shower like that, and I am very happy I didn't plan to wash my long and thick hair because that would have taken ages to carry out. 
The panel to choose room temperature was on the wall next to the bed and had a slight background light. That stayed on for the night too and after our eyes got used to the dark it felt like it lits up the whole room. This is only a problem if you are like me and need 100% dark to sleep. The airvents next to the window also made a loud and weird rumbling-knocking noise from time to time, I am happy I took my sleeping earplugs with me, because I am sure it would have woken me up.","The hotel is right next to the central station, but also walking distance (aboout 15 mins) to the Royal Palace and the entrance of Old town. Since we were there to explore museums and sightseeing, we didn't need to buy tickets for public transport but rather bought a Hop-On Hop-Off boat ticket what is valid for 2 days, and every morning we simply walked to the boat and it took us to all our destinations. It was fun and money-saving. 
The hotel itself is quite fancy for the average folk, like me. Beautiful interior design, super friendly and attentive staff members, quick and hassle-free check in and check out. 
Our room was the perfect size for two people. We got a queen size bed and fit in it nicely, even tho we are both over 100kg. The bed was very comfortable, but some might find it a bit too firm (we do like that). The pillows were ok for sleep, but for propping up our backs and watching tv, they were a bit too small/soft. The bed came with one big cover for couples, but we asked for 2 smaller one instead and they were very nice about it, we got the covers in about 20 mins, after asking for it.  The TV is better than in most hotels I have been at, it is the first time I was able to cast streaming services from my phone and watch whatever I wanted. Other places usually require hdmi cable to do that. 
We also tried out the roof-top bar. The view is breathtaking, the atmosphere is very friendly, cosy, quiet, the music is not super loud (like in other bars) so you can have a nice conversation over a drink. I will definitely return for shorter stays.",9.0,October 2023,"October 22, 2023",Standard Room,2,Couple,8.3

Dietary requirements (allergy to wheat) not catered for despite notifying hotel at the time of booking - unfortunately most gf bread in Sweden contains wheatstarch with a few exceptions, instead was told that I could pop into the local coop and buy some if I needed it. As breakfast was included with the deal I would have preferred the option of being offered something else if it was not possible to source gf bread without wheat starch.

"Reasonable for the price, more functional than luxurious.","It‚Äôs not the Hotel‚Äôs fault but I didn‚Äôt like the clientele much when I was there, when did leaving piles of food takeaway rubbish outside your room in the corridor become acceptable? This was frequent. Also the ‚Äòspa‚Äô is small, it was one day full of loud young men swearing, splashing and dominating the jacuzzi bath and another time full of toddlers. So not so much of a spa rather a municipal pool. This put me off booking a treatment. There are no staff supervising the pool, this could help perhaps as currently people can pay for one and then let all their friends in so no one monitors numbers properly. The downstairs bar area looked lovely but had the ambience of UK Weatherspoons on a Saturday lunchtime. Perhaps I am getting old. So don‚Äôt book specially because of the spa as you might be disappointed, if you like Weathies, you‚Äôll like the bar and if not there‚Äôs plenty of other places in Stockholm to drink.","Everything you would expect from a high rise chain Hotel. Really nice, welcoming staff particularly on arrival. Very spacious room and large bed with modern fittings and plenty of towels plus a robe and slippers provided. The location is directly next to the central station providing great access to the Metro.

I was also disappointed with the breakfast. Although food was plentiful, it was the same set every single day. I was especially disappointed that they did not serve hot/warm smoked salmon which was the only reason why I added the breakfast (i saw a video on you tube showing the breakfast spread from a couple of months back).","We chose this hotel because of the location and it more than met our expectations. It was literally next to the central station, and less than a 100 meters from the Arlanda express.

"Good, but with one very unprofessional staff member.","The only complaint we had was that the night security guard was rude. When it was closing time in the bar, we were ushered to the lobby, which was fine, but our friend (a non-resident) who was clearly finishing his drink was told that he had to leave (with a threat of ‚ÄòI will be back in two minutes‚Äô).  Our friend left, but this seemed entirely unnecessary.  We and other residents at the hotel were made to feel uncomfortable in the lobby and the security guard was also patrolling the main door in an aggressive and territorial way.  His attitude would definitely put me off of staying in the hotel again, which is a real shame as it was otherwise a very nice stay in beautiful Stockholm.",Great location.

Very Good,"Rooms need a renovation, there are scratches on the walls, worn down furniture, loose wallpaper and the window board was missing a piece. Also there was a little bit of black mold right next to the windowframe. We were first given a room with two single beds on the second floor although I booked a room with double bed; this room was far worse than the room on the 7th floor we then changed to after complaining at the reception, with a weird high pitched humming and a foul smell (they let us change rooms promptly after we complained about the single beds). So it is probably a little hit or miss depending on the room you‚Äôre getting. 
For using the pool/sauna it is required to reserve a time slot far in advance, which is not compatible with spending most of the day outside exploring the city, because you don‚Äôt really know when you will be back at the hotel. So we couldn‚Äôt use the pool/sauna once. The high bar on the 9th floor is a total rip-off in my opinion, with very overpriced cocktails that basically don‚Äôt contain alcohol and are very badly made; also, there is almost no view of the city, since the windows reflect light from inside. All in all, we would probably stay at the hotel again because the location is so convenient and our room was ok.","We had a superior room on the 7th floor with views of the central station and the stadshus tower.

I asked the reception to book a session but they advised me that they were unable to do so!

Well located hotel within a walking distance from the key tourists attractions,"Some furniture in the room were very old and need renovation, e.g. the paint from the mirror in the room was peeling off and the shower was flooding the bathroom. The daily cleaning service was coming late in the afternoon and was not really making the difference so I'd rather have an option to opt out from it completely. The rooftop bar is closed during the summer. I feel the hotel should be at least providing complimentary bottled water in the room (which is the case is other hotels) while the only water in Radisson Blu is a part of the minibar and therefore fairly expensive.",The hotel is located in a walking distance from basically everywhere. There was no need to use public transport to get to the old city (15 mins walk) as well as to the skansen (30-40 mins walk). Variety of shops and restaurants nearby was great.

"Can't expect perfect during the chaotic travel summer of 2022, but Radisson is still a good bet.","Two things that made our stay good rather than great: 

1) Given an incorrect, double room *twice* in a row, despite having booked for a two-single room and changing rooms at the desk. Very annoying to have to haul bags up and down again to change rooms. Finally just settled with the double to avoid another trip. Not the end of the world, and the staff was apologetic about what seemed to be a computer error, but not impressive for the standard of hotel. 

2) Pool wasn't open on Sunday early evening at 6pm or on Monday morning until 11am. Note the limited hours if you're looking to enjoy the (wonderful) pool area.","Great breakfast. Great location.

"Overall, good value for money. Location is really perfect. Walking distance to all the important sites.","We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and our room wasn‚Äôt clean even once. It‚Äôs not that the house keeping didn‚Äôt show up, but they come at a strange hour, around 3-4pm which was usually the time we would come back to the room to rest before we go out again. In most hotels I‚Äôve visited around the world, the rooms are cleaned in the morning which makes much more sense. The second morning of our stay we asked at the reception if our room can be cleaned at that time (in the morning), they said of course, but the cleaning lady came again around 4pm while we were in the room. So, in the end, our room wasn‚Äôt cleaned at all. 

Another thing we didn‚Äôt like was the strange pool policy to stop the spread of the virus. This will probably be changed now when Sweden eases the restrictions however, during our stay there was a policy that you have to book the pool and max of 10 people can stay at one time and for no longer than 45 minutes. The jacuzzi allows max of 4 people inside and it was always full. Once it finally empties and we get a chance to enjoy it for at least 10 minutes, the jacuzzi turns off and starts self-cleaning and during this time you are not allowed in. it seems that the cleaning lasts longer than the actual jacuzzi working time so we would get 5-7 mins of jacuzzi time max which was a big shame. Never saw in any hotel before that the jacuzzi stops every 10-15 minutes to clean itself‚Ä¶ 

Also, unless you pay for a premium room, you won‚Äôt get bathrobes and you will have to go to the pool fully dressed and change there in the locker rooms. I believe it‚Äôs not a luxury to provide bathrobes to all guests.","The hotel is in a perfect location, right next to the central station.

"Yeah, there are some points to be fixed. But in the end, this place meets my expectations.","First, Please put proper wardrobe in rooms. I was there for 2 weeks so that i needed to bring lots of things to wear since this is winter too. But there were not enough places nor a wardrobe to put my clothes in the room.

Second, The lady that has done my check-in in the first day i arrived does not seem ""easy-going"". Here are the reasons:
* She told me that ""everyday i have breakfast, i should definitely make a reservation for breakfast, otherwise i couldn't get any."" This sounds a bit aggressive. Don't you think?. Besides, i found out later on that actually no reservation needed for breakfast whether it's weekdays or weekend. This is also what other staff said. 
* On first day, when i swipe my credit card to POS machine, saw a warning on the screen that i couldn't understand, not because i don't speak English, but i hadn't used this machine before. So in first try, i couldn't get what the problem was (what machine saying on the screen despite this is English.) So i said ""i think the card didn't work."". Then she said ""yeah, it seems so. This is English, don't you see?"". I mean, this is aggressive too :)
* Lastly, When i check-in the hotel, my booking was from 10th of Dec to 26th Dec. But same lady said ""your staying is till 24th of Dec"". So i asked her to update and reschedule it to 26th of Dec. She said yes. She said she did it. But in the night of 24th of Dec, when i got back to my room, my card did not open the door. Seems she didn't extend it despite she said she did. I don't know what her problem was with me :) one of other staff solved this issue as well. Thanks a lot to her.

Third, WiFi connection quality was not good enough. sometimes goes off because of poor signal.","Breakfast was great, lots of options there. This is great.

"Good stay on a budget and great position, but a lot of room for improvement","The staff is not well connected with the spa/gym. Apparently they have an agreement/partnership but they struggle to book for you or give you any indication of the facilities at the pool site.
Cleanliness is something they have to get better at. Glasses and mugs in the room were not changed from one day to the other and coffee selection was not replenished. Also, we left the room really early in the morning and there was a horrible vomit smell in the elevator. I understand it's no-one fault if some guests vomited in it, but I expect the staff to clean it quickly and make sure no smell is left before putting it back in full operation.
Mini-bar was entirely empty. When we asked to the main bar for a bottle of water they said they did not have it and we could have had water from the tap.

"Elegant, comfortable, centrally located to mass transit, COVID-testing on-site for travelers.","Not much to dislike really. One staff member (who was very helpful in many ways) suggested we do our COVID tests in town at a local health facility, but when we checked, there were no available online reservations, and the hotel's testing site was quick and affordable. So I would just suggest that staff may want to recommend the hotel site for testing. The only other thing I wished for was an outlet in the bathroom, but that's really reaching for things to dislike!","The beds were super-comfy, the downstairs restaurant was lovely and had good food (nice waiter), the staff was super-helpful, and it was a stone's throw away from the Central Station for the trains/city trams and the City Terminal for the buses/fast train to the airport, which was very convenient. Breakfast was not included but we opted for it the second day and it was great -- plenty of options for all kinds of tastes/nationalities. We also took advantage of the fun pool/jacuzzi (must be reserved ahead). Possibly most convenient of all, there was a COVID testing center on-site where we were able to get tested before our flight back home.

I‚Äôve stayed in many hotels in Africa, where there is always someone helping with your luggage and showing you to your room. Here nobody offered to help. Not sure if it is not a service offered by this hotel, hotels generally in Sweden/Europe, or if it is due to covid measures. 

The rooftop bar, restaurants and room service services were also not fully operational, due to covid.

Great central location hotel with top facilities,"Communication from staff at the hotel.
On checking in, we were not told about the building work to the upper floors (floor 8) which was affecting the premium room with lake view that we booked and scaffolding had obscured the view out of the window, and the bathroom window had been completely covered, we had to discover it ourselves. There was no mention on the website about ongoing work either or when booking via booking.com. On raising this concern with the front desk they did refund us the difference between a lake and courtyard room which was appreciated, however the communication in the first place could have been better, as these works and rooms affected would have been known prior to the guest checking in. 

Secondly, this was our second time staying at the Radisson, and on check in I asked what time the rooftop bar was open until, and given the times by the front desk. We planned our evening around this and returned after dinner to visit the roof top bar for some drinks, to find it closed for a private event.

Great property. Make sure that you can exit your room easily.,The incompetent staff member. Common sense isn't so common.,"Anna at the front desk was exceptionally helpful.

We told him that we could not spend our week worrying about getting out of the room. We went down with him. He spoke with Anna, who changed our room (upgraded). 
I  double-checked twice to make sure  that they flagged the room # 449 and didn't assign it until it was fixed.
