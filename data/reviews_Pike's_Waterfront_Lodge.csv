"Very fun place to stay at a reasonable price. Good location by the water, great food and ambience.","Pillows were so thick that I had to create my own out of towels! So, I would like more pillow options because some people like a flat pillow. Of course, I didn't call the front desk about this...so my fault using towels.","The breakfast, included with our stay, was great- so many options including polenta! fresh fruit, real eggs, large tables to meet and talk with other folks. I like the themed rooms and decor- some people didn't but I appreciated it and the humor. We took advantage of the free theater to watch a film about the aurora; and the library. Loved sitting out at night in a small garden, around a fire pit, tornado lamps caught my husband's eye. Lots of people were staying here but the expansive lobbies and outdoor sitting areas helped make it seem more intimate. Oh and the $1.50 ice cream was a treat.",9.0,August 2024,"August 10, 2024",King Room,2,Couple,8.8

I stayed on night in an ""Aurora View"" room prior to a three night stay in a comfy cabin. Comfortable common areas and the theatre room showing an old but interesting Aurora doco was good.

Great Hotel,"Everything was good.

I like the view from my room, the hotel has Aurora room view and it is possible to see the North Light from your room if you are lucky. They have a nice breakfast even though they are the same every day waffles, eggs, potatoes, coffee or tea, will be great to have more fruit such as oranges or apples. Some of the  personnel are not so nice but 90% are helping people. The hotel is fat from the city which is a good cause it is quieter but you need to rent a  car if you want to move or pay a taxi or Uber. However if you want to see the North Lights it is the best hotel to get it. Also the hotel has a Sauna which is clean and nice for a relaxing night.

Will probably return as there more pros than cons.,"Check in was a problem as the clerk would not understand that we had service dogs and would not give us the cabin we had reserved. My husband had to go to the desk the next day to find out what their policy was for service dogs. We did get our room changed to a cabin, however they did not offer to assist us in our move. Considering I had unpacked everything for the week it was an inconvenience because to quickly repack we just threw things back in our bags not taking the time to fold things to fit everything in our bags. We also had to make another trip to the grocery store since we now had a full refrigerator rather then a mini fridge.  All of this took a chunk out of our 1st full day there. There was a nut shell under the bed along with something else that one our dogs ate before I could get to it.","Breakfast was good and the variety was good. Most of the staff were very friendly.

I would choose this place anytime In Fairbanks,,The breakfast was excellent. The staff were very responsive.

"Great lodgings for couples, families, business people.","Just a couple of nits.
For the 6 days that we were there, the breakfast offered was plentiful but exactly the same thing every single day (scrambled eggs, waffles, plain yogurt, English muffins, sausages, fried potatoes, hash, and oatmeal.) I would have liked just a little variety. If we'd stayed here just 3 or 4 days, I wouldn't have even noticed it, but by the 5th and 6th days, I wanted something else.
The room decor was maybe just a little dated; heavy brocade drapes for the bathtub/shower curtain was a tad odd.
The room's thermostat was adjustable but the temperature would not get cooler than 70, and usually not cooler than 72. At night for sleeping, that was a little too warm for us.
That's all I can think of. We really did enjoy staying here.","I liked the homey atmosphere of the lodge, and that breakfast was included. I liked that it was located right along the Chena River, away from downtown Fairbanks. It was quieter and parking wasn't an issue.
The balcony overlooked the river, so we had a great view. I would go out on the balcony to look up at the sky--it was beautiful! But cold. Super cold.
Most of the staff were friendly, professional, helpful. (There was only one staff member who was just okay, the rest were excellent.)
I loved that they had ice cream for sale in the lobby every night from 6 pm - 9 pm (yes, even in December when the temps were -26!), and it cost only $1 for a generous scoop. They had quite a few flavors to choose from, like maybe ten or twelve. The huckleberry was exceptional!
I appreciated the free airport transfers; the drivers were very friendly, conscientious, and helpful.
Having a refrigerator and a microwave in the room was a big plus in my book. More pluses were the fitness center, the sauna, and the steam room. The patio looked so inviting with nice furniture and gas-fired fire pits but the outdoor temps were just too freakin' cold to sit out there.

The steam sauna, though enjoyable, could also use a good bit of cleaning, as you can tell that it has a little mildew growing due to type of environment.","I enjoyed the over all experience.

The ice cream social is a delight, including the premium quality of the ice cream and the limited but nice selection of unique flavors.  I realize that the ice cream was complimentary in the past but $1.00 a cup is still a bargain!  It was also so nice to have good quality hot coffee available at all times in the main lobby.

Super grateful,Our room didn’t get cleaned the entire time we were there (4 nights) and we had to ask for extra towels and TP and throw out our trash.   Not a huge deal but once would have been nice.  I personally don’t like my room cleaned daily.  We also didn’t report it bc it wasn’t anything important to either of us and we had no problem getting extra towels or TP.,"Breakfast was amazing and daily coffee and the staff 🫶🏼

BEYOND anything I ever imagined!!! A home away from home--with a rich relative we all wished we had!,,"The hot breakfast was amazing! We appreciated that they served it until 9am every day. The free shuttle from the airport and the wakeup call for the Northern Lighs was an extra bonus. We found the gift shop to be very reasonably priced and the $1 ice cream at night and the smores around the campfire were super special. I was also intrigued by the various offerings onsite there--- the WONDERFUL ART display, the vast book collection and games for use---- the theater room, pool table and pet walking areas. Having the snow sled area down to the river and the full restaurant next door were special perks, as well!  I would definitely go back to PIKE'S!!!",10,March 2023,"March 8, 2023",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,8,Group,8.8
Great property convenient for all activities,"Breakfast was the same every morning. Although there were plenty of choices, allowing one to eat something different each day, it would have been nice if the hot selection varied from eggs, potatoes, and hash. Try some meat (bacon, sausage)!","Very convenient to the Fairbanks airport, Pike's Waterfront Lodge also offers an array of services and activities that will please most travelers. Don't miss the ""Love Alaska"" sign across the Chena River (walkable in winter) or the Aurora film in the little log-cabin theater or the all-glass ""Aurorium"" (too bad they don't keep the glass roof clear of ice!).
Attendants Mandi, Rix, and Kat at breakfast were all a joy – thanks, ladies! – and Christian was a helpful source of tips and service.

Excellence!,I can’t think of a single legitimate complaint.,"Our visit got off to a rough start. We were unpacking when it occurred to me that our room didn’t meet the description of the one I’d booked, no balcony, no outside door, no river view. I stepped down to the desk and advised the clerk that I’d been assigned the wrong lodging. I showed her my contract from Booking.com. She said to move me to the correct room would require an upgrade which could only be granted by a manager. She summoned a manager. The manager advised me that my Booking.com contract was meaningless as Booking.com doesn’t guarantee a specific type of room. I pointed out that my current room assignment had no balcony and no view other than the parking lot. She moved me from the third floor to the second and assigned me a room that perfectly matched the description on my contract. It was all sunshine and roses after the tense mixup. As unhappy as the manager seemed I expected she’d find me a room right next door to a noisy garbage bin, but I believe she might’ve given me the room I would’ve selected if given a choice of the entire property. The property is definitely where you want to stay in Fairbanks. We’ve driven hundreds of miles while here site-seeing and searching for the Northern Lights, and I’ve yet to see a comparable property. The hotel is located right along the Chena River, which would be a real plus during warm weather. The hotel doesn’t provide maid service, but there always seems to be workers in the hallway who are friendly and willing to change out towels, which is really all that we require as we’re accustomed to policing up after ourselves and making our bed. The breakfast provided with the room is way above average. The workers there keep everything stocked and moving. Scrambled eggs, English muffins, potatoes with onions and corned beef hash are on the menu every morning along with cereal, yogurt, hot cakes and a slow cooker with oatmeal. Parking is plentiful and electrical outlets with each spot are provided. The sauna is a nice.",10,February 2023,"February 14, 2023",King Room,3,Couple,8.8

I am not sure if this is because of being a Booking.com guest and only certain rooms were blocked off, or why they were particular about the room. but we had waited quite a while and we have been frequent guests there as well. it was just disappointing.","good location, comfortable rooms, quiet, friendly",10,January 2023,"January 17, 2023",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,1,Couple,8.8

It was a pleasant stay with the exception of booking.com.,"We could not cancel our reservation, but our reservation included transportation into town, a service which the hotel decided to cancel. It was a a 30 minute walk one way to the closest supermarket which we did have to make. So we cannot cancel our part of the contract but they can cancel their obligations! We were already a later check-in and when we checked in they told us our room wasn’t ready. We asked if we could set our bags aside and go next-door to have some thing to eat and we were told it would only be a couple of minutes. 25 minutes later we went back to the person who told us to wait for our room and she told us that she was going off duty and we had to talk to somebody else. As it turns out there was a place we could’ve put our luggage to wait only feet away from where we waited; we were hungry and only wanted to go next door to get something to eat. Meanwhile nobody else had to wait for a room when they were checking in.

Comfortable accommodations with a wonderful breakfast in the land of the Northern Lights,,The staff is friendly and accommodating.

They went above and beyond to help us with things that were not even their problem (e.g. our issues with our airline and getting us to and from the airport to drop off our car even after we had checked out of the hotel). They kept our bags in the baggage room even after check out without any hesitation. We had blisters on day 3 and the staff helped us with bandages free of cost. The breakfast was amazing and the woman who cooks it went out of her way multiple mornings to ask me if I wanted something special to drink. I loved her.

Pikes,Retired quickly of housekeeping banging on our door and then disappearing when we went to answer the door a couple of seconds later on two different occasions even though our do not disturb was on the door. A shuttle driver didn't say anything when he picked us up which was a little bit odd. He did thank me when I tipped him so at least we know he speaks. The lady who was working breakfast who seemed to be a manager of sorts who was snipping at a couple of the guests. If I saw one more I would have said something and that would not have gone well.,"Location was fantastic and the place is very clean and we really enjoyed the artwork. We also like that the owner was there helping out and pitching in wherever he was needed. We liked the ice cream in Alaska and some of the staff were really terrific. The Wi-Fi worked fairly well.

"4 nights during Icemageddon, the Great Interior Alaska 2021 Blizzards","Nothing actually. There were some mini power issues and long queues. It was a bit annoying in the beginning. But later I stayed 2 nights in another place in Fairbanks and realized it was a common issue across Fairbanks due to the blizzard.

Please take negative reviews from Dec 24, 2021 - Jan 1, 2022 with a grain of salt, especially on power issues (it was all over Fairbanks), slow shuttles (roads were in a horrible condition), noise (late arrivals due to late or canceled flights), and food variety (no delivery of materials to the kitchen).

The hotel staff did their best, despite the Christmas-NY vacation and the blizzards.","It was a historical record-breaking blizzard, dubbed as ""Icemageddon."" Due to that, unfortunately, the northern lights were not visible (although predicted high as Kp=4 during the stay). Otherwise, it would be a sure thing. Chena River was frozen just in the backside of the hotel. Just walk across the frozen river to the ""Love Alaska"" sign and enough darkness to witness the northern lights in peace.

Luckily, I went further north and spent 2 nights in Utqiagvik where I saw the northern lights on both nights.

Special mention to the bartender, Ursula. She handled everything elegantly. The gentleman did a great job too. Shuttle drivers and the rest of the staff were nice as well.",10,December 2021,"January 6, 2022",King Room,4,Solo traveler,8.8

"Nice hotel, nice environment, just wish I could’ve slept","I checked in at 5 PM, went out at 6:30. I never thought to check the temperature of the room because it seemed fine. By the time I cozied myself in bed at 10 PM the thermostat read 51 but the room temperature was 75. Tried to adjust, tried to adjust and tried to adjust. Opened the screen door that lead to the parking lot to let some air in. Called the front desk and one of the drivers came in to try to help and he did the same. I was up half the night boiling.

"Set your alarm, don't come late to breakfast.","Our first morning there we overslept and came to breakfast about 5 minutes before closing. Our bad. It took us a couple minutes to figure out where to get coffee, etc. I was just about to get food when I was stampeded by a group of about 15 employees who swooped in and took all the food that was left.  My husband had a waffle half-cooked that was taken away along with all the other serving dishes. When I complained to the kitchen manager she yelled at me and said it was my own fault for being late. When I asked if I could at least get a glass of orange juice she said she'd give me some if I changed my attitude! The people at the front desk were not surprised when I told them this story; said they've received many complaints about her. 
I had trouble getting Wi-Fi in my room, but was able to in one of the common areas.","The buffet breakfast is great (but get there well before closing time).

A couple of the staff working the breakfast had the same rolling eyes habit when talking to guests, their body language was they don’t like people.

A special place to make those special moments even more special.,"We had a king size bed that slept like it was well beyond it's ""USED UP"" date.  It basically had lots of little hills and valleys that left us a little achy after 2 nights.  The pillows were also a bit too plump for us, but neither issue was enough to make us not want to stay here again.","This stay was a special birthday/anniversary/holiday treat for us.  The best part was the jacuzzi bathtub right in the corner of the room.  We managed to squeeze in 3 soaks during our 2-night stay and fully enjoyed each one.  This was a rare treat for us as we only have a small shower at home.  The tub was just big enough for two with plenty of hot water and lots of ""jet action"".  Having it right there next to the bed and in front of the TV was lots of fun as opposed to being in the bathroom.  We will definitely consider staying here again for future special occasions.

It was also fun looking out over the Chena River.  We kept our eyes peeled for any dogsled teams running the river but only managed to catch a few people walking their dogs.....oh well, maybe another time.  The river wasn't completely frozen over at the time of our stay in February.  

Finally, the hotel has lots of interesting nooks and crannies to explore.  We visited the restaurant next door for their signature Prime Rib/Dagwood sandwich (excellent!), the saloon/lounge for evening ice cream (again: excellent!) and walked around the grounds outside a bit to see the carvings and ice sculptures.  There were other things to do and see, but we just didn't have enough time for it all.

Great home  base for activities,We were assigned a room in a separate building. Had to go to the main building to use facilities and for breakfast. This meant bundling up to go outside (a short walk but still outside in sib-zero temperatures) to go to breakfast. This inconvenience also kept us from using the sauna and going over for evening ice cream. One additional disappointment was the Aurora room was not available. This was a big reason we booked the hotel.,Close to airport and easy for transport for all activities.

Solid accommodations in Fairbanks,Nothing -it's my go-to hotel in Fairbanks.,"I have stayed at the Pike's Waterfront Lodge on several occasions. The location is ideal for someone coming late from elsewhere - a mile from the airport, with a shuttle if you need it.

Great family hotel!,The rooms are very small there is not even a closet but a wardrobe that takes up even more space. It’s fine if you do not plan to spend a lot of time in your room.

Cozy and welcoming!,"The worst part of our whole trip here was that there are no rental cars available! We had plans to drive to Denali National park but couldn’t!! Taxi’s are very pricey! For a 3 mile trip it’s about 15 dollars. The shuttle at the hotel would charge 5 dollars to and then 5 dollars back to take you to a only a few locations that they allow. They will not take you just anywhere. We had no success trying to get an Uber either. They are hardly known here. Every time I tried it said UNAVAILABLE. You are Stuck on their property unless you have an excursion that will come and get you.
The hotel was clean for the most part, besides being a bit dusty , and the carpets in the hotel and especially the restaurant need cleaning or replacing desperately!!","Overall this place is very nice. They have a restaurant, which the food was good. I would say like Bar food and the service was good, being that they are short on help they were pretty fast.
They have a separate building you can go to and play pool or read a book and they also have a little theatre.

Disappointing stay at the hotel,I booked summer 2023 for April 2024. I thought booking early would get us a room to view the Aurora Borealis. Unhappy because we were given a room facing the parking lot with light pollution. It was in a separate building so we had to wear our coats to go eat breakfast in the main building. VERY DISAPPOINTED in our 3 night stay. Told by a young rude girl at the front desk that since we did not book directly with them that is why we got the room we did. I made the reservation almost  8 mos in advance. The place was packed and on the day of departure at breakfast packed with Marines. The front desk also gave us wrong information about the shuttle to attractions which cost $20 each way plus tips yet is free in the peak season. WE WOULD NEVER GO BACK.

Good-value 3-star kitsch palace,"The decor of the rooms and many areas of the hotel was dated in that way that invites questions about cleanliness; I'm sure they clean in there because they use an exceptionally odorous disinfectant, but there are just some carpets/coverlets/curtains that are never going to seem clean after 1995. Sometimes you could not, in fact, find a parking spot with the outlet, and I don't think it was other guests, it seemed that assorted other towns people parked their vehicles there. There was a kind of harshly phrased note in the room demanding that you drop off housekeeping tips to the front desk, which I don't like; I mean we always tip, I just don't think I should hand it over to anyone other than the housekeeping staff servicing the room that day; it really made me wonder about the cult thing. Are any of the staff trapped there? I don't know. They seemed happy...there was a sometimes sinister edge to the cult thing on some of the signs about ducks.","Good value; decent free breakfast and free ice cream in the evening. Great location. The bathroom in our room appeared to have been recently renovated and was very clean, and the toiletries were surprisingly good; it also had one of those dreaded wall-mounted blow-dryers but surprisingly an ok one.

The place has gigantic kitsch value, the kind you simply can't fake, though the place sometimes seemed like it was stretching to appear  ""in on the joke."" There's a LOT of art all over the place (like a LOT....almost too much) and to my surprise most of it was either weird/interesting or actually....good? There's some weird Lynchean/cult-like thing going on with ducks and possibly the staff.  Also the owner of the hotel, a local politician whose search for a Jewish fiancee willing to move to Fairbanks in the 90s made some headlines at the time, was there a lot. There was some quality to the whole place that seemed over-determined, but usually in a beneficial way because this meant that you get a surprisingly good number of amenities at the price point -- a full ironing board and iron; a minifridge, microwave, tea and coffee, mugs, an ice machine, a TV with tons of channels and netflix connectivity, etc. The parking lot was large and we could generally find a spot with an outlet to plug in the car to keep the battery from dying.

The staff was generally quite friendly and helpful, though with that weird Alaska thing going on...you'll know what I mean when you go there. The bartender in the hotel bar told us it was her first day, and we had to give her instructions about how to make all three of the drinks we wanted, and they were not good; however, I have to give her points for her high-effort attempt and can-do attitude (we offered to take simpler drinks, but she insisted on trying).",7.0,November 2021,"December 21, 2021",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,4,Group,8.8

Disappointing,"The hotel has ignored my request for a ride from the airport although it is declared as available to all. I asked to change the room but my request was not satisfied. The door to the ground floor ""balcony"" has a broken lock and is sequired with a wooden plank - looks real ""safe""! Through the night I couldn't sleep because quite a few men had a party in the lounge next door; the hotel staff didn't bother to intervene until asked. Unlike advertised, the breakfast is cheep and cheerful: food is basic, disposable plates, cups and cutlery, no fruit whatsoever. I can't blame the service though - all clean.","Public areas are well presented with quite a few information boards on the history.

"Well, at least it’s a warm and dry bed.","The breakfast is very basic. There’s no room service and the room are only cleaned once every four days according to the reception. Which meant for us staying for four nights, no one ever cleaned our room. It would’ve been nice to have some bottled water in the room, but it is not offered. The Wi-Fi system is problematic. We stayed in a cabin, and it barely worked. Explanation I received from the reception is because of the location of our cabin. The Wi-Fi does not work well there. But if Wi-Fi was essential for us, they offered to move us into the main hotel. Which sort of defeated the purpose of having a cabin, and the first place. Also, the hotel staff, although professional, doesn’t seem to be all that friendly. They are not rude or unprofessional. But they’re not friendly either.","The location of the hotel is excellent. It’s only a few minutes from the airport. Also, the hotel airport shuttle is very efficient and timely.  Also, the rooms are well heated which is a bonus. And the water for the shower gets very hot.

Rooms were old and antiquated with bathrooms that could have come from the 1930s.

I called and asked the front desk if they could shut them off and she was quite rude saying they could not...she didnt even say sorry for the inconvienence..we all know a simple pull of the plug would of solved the problem...however she didnt see a problem from her location behind the front desk. I talked to the manager on duty the next morning during check out assuming that there would be some kind of compensation for my stay.. but all she told me was that From now on they'll turn the lights out at 9 PM..

High price for cheap and tacky,"When I first got to my room, it had pubic hairs in the tub and some white, crusty glob on the sofa. The sheet had been only half put on, so I had to pull down the corners myself. They sent staff within 15 min to clean again, but after the guy cleaned the sofa, I told him about the pubes in the tub, and he offered me the bottle of cleaning solution and asked if id like it for the tub! I asked if he intended for me to clean the tub, which is when it seemed to register that it's his job. He did clean well, after that, but there's only maid service every four days. They claim this is due to covid staffing shortages, but the hotel was packed full, so they need to rehire appropriate staff.
After the new cleaning, I realized there was no internet in the room, and when I asked about it, the staff at reception said she'd reset it, but treated me like I was annoying her. Zero apologies.

The room wasn't heating properly and by the next day wasn't working at all. They sent a repairman, but it broke again 3 min after he left, so I called the front desk, and again, they treated me like I was putting them out. 10 min later, a guy shows up with a space heater: No explanation or apology. I had to clarify from him that the heater would not be fixed, and I had to have a space heater for the rest of my stay.

Housekeeping came on the third day, but turned on the alarm (as I never touched the clock and the only people to come in was housekeeping, this is the only explanation - I can't imagine why they would do this unless it was punishment for complaining about the level of cleanliness when I arrived), so I was jolted awake at 6am! When I told reception about it, I was treated like I was making it up or it was an accident. When I noted that alarms have to be set deliberately, I was given a look of annoyance and offered no apology. Also, all housekeeping did was rinse the tub and remake the bed, which was done so sloppily that I ended up redoing it myself.","Lovely dining room

The only ones I found to be friendly and helpful were the guys from the Car Service, which is super expensive btw but you're stuck with that since there aren't any more options to move around town if you don have your own car. Not once I encountered a ladie at the front desk who wasn't rude to me and I believe everything I asked was fair information for a traveler.

The front desk staff don't work at the happiest hotel in Alaska.,"The front desk was rude and no help, no information on the hotel where anything was, breakfast timing, or even where the rooms were located. Being busy shouldn't mean rudeness in a service industry.  We were left trying to figure out where our rooms were and what building they were in. The breakfast attendant was very rude. We asked for a higher floor 6 months prior and we're told we'd have to pay more money to get it and didn't so we got stuck on the first floor which is very loud. The sinks and bathtubs were slow draining in all three rooms.  We chose this hotel because of the Aurora viewing room which is a joke because there is so much light in and around it that you can't see through the windows it just reflects everything in the room. All three rooms were very dimly lit even with all the lights on you couldn't see to pack up and the bathroom fans were very loud which you couldn't turn off if you wanted light.

I called and asked the front desk if they could shut them off and she was quite rude saying they could not...she didnt even say sorry for the inconvienence..we all know a simple pull of the plug would of solved the problem...however she didnt see a problem from her location behind the front desk. I talked to the manager on duty the next morning during check out assuming that there would be some kind of compensation for my stay.. but all she told me was that From now on they'll turn the lights out at 9 PM.. That really didnt help my situation.. I booked this property solely for the fact that I could look out the Window towards the North without having to get out of Bed to Check for the northern Lights.
I have friends and family rate that I could Used at the Marriott the whole time But instead wasted my money on a poorly displayed disco show on my ceiling...very disappointing.

"Good location, not very comfortable stay","The staff seemed rushed, irritated and not fully aware of a lot of issues.   The whole place seems outdated and run down.  It has a feel of a hotel from 1980's and I know Alaska has a run down rough charm but it's a little much considering the price you pay per night.  The money obviously isn't going to up keep or improvements.  The sheets feel cheap and the nylon comforter was dirty not to mention gross feeling.  you get one flimsy sheet and nylon blanket for warmth in Alaskan winter a synthetic or some type of actual blanket, comforter would be nice. Also the carpets are all worn and old in rooms and halls.  The place is worth $80 a night but definitely not $160.","Location, although there was no way to contact them from airport phone to get the shuttle and I ended up helping other international travelers that did not have cell, wifi, or data service.

Can not recommend.

If any manager reads these reviews, I'd like an explanation. Been sitting in the lobby for over an hour now.

Edit. When finally checking in was given a bargain basement room and when asked why was told that because we booked through booking.com Wed get a standard room only.
