Exceptional,Nothing to mention here.,"Location great in Downtown Atlanta, loads of great bars and restaurants nearby. Also walking distance from major attractions.

Expectations were not met because of poor communication.,"I was sent a ""pre-check in"" text that allowed for a check in and place to scan a drivers license. Upon arrival it was as if that had never happened. Why did I do this if the attendant was annoyed that I asked why I had to go thru every thing again! Forget that electronic crap if at arrival I have to wait in a long line to do it all over again.
The breakfast (which is free at most hotels cost 60.00 for two people) We were given two 10.00 coupons but only one was allowed to be used at the breakfast seeking to force a second visit. That is a sorry way to handle the coupons. Advertised parking but only offered valet parking for 45.00 per night.",After check inn the staff was friendly and helpful. Room was adequate but the bed was not as comfortable as many other hotels I have stayed in.,6.0,August 2024,"August 13, 2024",Deluxe Queen Room with Two Queen Beds - Non-Smoking,2,Couple,7.2
Nice Hotel but too many expensive ‚Äúaccommodations ‚Äú,"Parking Fee and what essentially having to opt for the Valet.  I think paying guests should not have to pay for parking.  I didn‚Äôt know where the parking garage was and felt forced into using the Valet who kept moving my seat when driving my car.  That was irritating. Once I realized where the garage was, I had already used the Valet and as I was there only 1 night, I paid it. 

The elevator on my side of the building was not working and I had to walk a marathon to get to an elevator.  I am disabled so that was not convenient at all. 

There is no microwave in the rooms.  Bizarre.  No courtesy coffee for guests unless you count the crappy 2-cup coffee maker in the room which is never, ever decent coffee. 

Before ever getting there, I called the hotel to advise I was traveling with young teens and that I needed us to be together and when I got there, our rooms were in different places around the floor.  On arrival, I told the Clerk we needed our rooms together and she kindly provided them but, as I said, on the side of the hotel the farthest from the elevator.","It was very close to the Aquarium, our reason for going.",6.0,July 2024,"August 13, 2024",Double Room with Two Double Beds - Non-Smoking,1,Family,7.2

"Great location, clean hotel...but a few hiccups","When we got there, parking was full at the facility. We had to park across the street in a public parking lot (which turned out to be cheaper and convenient...so, a happy accident!). We never tried to park at the facility after that. 
When we tried to eat at the buffet for breakfast or in one of the on-site restaurants, they were always closed. On a Monday morning, nothing was open but the ala carte area which was not ideal. They had premade breakfast sandwiches, muffins, etc...but not very palatable and no fresh fruit. We were very disappointed with this aspect of our stay as we asked at the front desk the night before if the restaurant was open the next morning and were told 'yes'. We did go to the Metro Diner and Bar a couple of blocks from the hotel for dinner and breakfast. We highly recommend this place as an alternative.","The rooms were clean, spacious and sufficient for our stay. Staff were pleasant and helpful during check-in.

Pleasant,"We booked two doubles, ended up with a Queen, this was not comfortable.

We were supposed to have a courtyard view and ended up with an external view. This is a very noisy area, parties, music, traffic, so a courtyard view was preferred.

No literature regarding the tv and the channels. After a long day one should not have to battle with the front desk trying to get the tv to work and find a guide. Ultimately a guide is not available, whether on the tv or in print.

If you have an issue with poverty and homeless people begging for money and food, I suggest you stay elsewhere and always use a taxi for travel. That being said, it is a reality and you donate or don't donate as you see fit. Not a reflection on the hotel, just the local area.

Hotel is close to the downtown, maybe a five to ten minute walk. But keep in mind that 50 to 60 percent of the shops are vacant.

Also the shower head didnt stay in the holder so showering was very uncomfortable.

One of the valets wouldn‚Äôt get out of my vehicle when I was in a hurry to leave. He was taking an international call from my drivers seat. The breakfast wasn‚Äôt complimentary, the internet wasn‚Äôt complimentary.

Very Good,Our room was very warm and stuffy feeling throughout the whole stay even though the AC was set at 60. The garage is very very tight and the way that it is set up that you have to walk along a pathway through the garage to a side door in order to enter the hotel is very confusing. Not all doors are working to be able to gain access with your car key either. Our stairwell on the first level was locked during the entire stay which is a fire hazard. The layout of the hotel is very confusing. For instance there are two different first floor levels. It takes a couple days to figure out the layout of the land. We found a big spider in our room the first day we were there but after that there was nothing we just let it go outside.,I really enjoyed the text feature that you have to offer where you can text the front desk and with my experience they responded in a prompt timely fashion. There is a Metro City Diner that is walking distance which is pretty good. There is also a Subway that is walking distance as well. The gift shop and the Starbucks were great features to have inside the hotel as well for optional choices for snacks and food. They had food trucks outside as well which opened at 2:00 p.m. and they were good.,8.0,April 2023,"April 18, 2023","Guest room, 2 Queen",4,Family,7.2

Overall our experience at the hotel was sad because the homeless population is out of control.,"I am saddened and alarmed at the homeless situation near this hotel.  My husband and I were approached multiple times on the street as we walked to Wahlburgers minutes from this hotel.  Then when we returned to the Sheraton, we pressed the elevator and a man was sitting inside on the floor naked covered by a paper. He was speaking incoherently and I was shocked.  Immediately we tried the second elevator but it was being held up on the 12th floor so we made the decision to report the situation to the front desk, but a staff member met us on the way.  Together, we went back to the elevators and the Sheraton staff member pressed the elevator button and informed us that another guest reported the man in the elevator.  The staff member promptly apologized for our distress and she requested security to come and remove the man from the elevator.  As security arrived he also apologized for this sad turn of events.","Check-in was a breeze, even though I used a third party, they were quickly able to locate the reservation.  The room was clean and excellent.  The hot water was very hot.  The air conditioner was working at a nice comfortable level all night not humming or rattling as I have experienced in the past with other hotels.  We received extra towels as soon as we requested them.  The staff was friendly and very accomodating.

I asked about ""self-parking"" upon check-in in which was listed as an option and the staff did not know a single thing about it when I asked how it worked. I understand they do not own or run the garage but as a hospitality worker, they should have been able to provide me with basic information like cost. The parking garage was across the street but it was the sketchiest place I have ever been. It looked and smelled like homeless people had been living in there.

"All and all, I would go elsewhere.  I‚Äôve gotten better service from Motel 6.","CONS:
-	Leaves doors unlocked/ajar
-	Enjoys abusing guest credit cards
-	Ignores special requests
-	Does not follow up on issues
-	$45 valet parking or $35 self parking
-	No ‚Äúfree‚Äù breakfast unless you use $10 or less of the voucher given
-	Did not see any USB charging ports
-	Extra charging power strip UNDER side table
-	Super long and slow valet/parking lines
-	Super long and slow check in
-	In Downtown ATL so has everything that goes along with big city downtowns
-	Rooms anything but soundproof

Long, slow valet & self park lines. I get inside the hotel and there is another really long slow line.   To top it off, the staff is also taking an unusually long time checking in each guest. 

There is much cheaper parking ($25/night or $15 depending on check in/out time) a block or two down on the same side of the street.

Finally checked in, I get up to my room.  Not only is it RIGHT NEXT TO an Elevator, the stairs AND the Ice Machine (all of which I requested my room be away from and that they agreed to) but the door is not even locked.  In fact, it is ajar and the cord to the phone missing. I‚Äôm told they will get right on that‚Ä¶.and  I never hear back from them again before I check out the next morning.  I could hear drag racing from outside, people talking (regular level) in the halls and the elevator all night long.

As of this morning, this $112 stay has cost me $536 in holds on my credit card, including charges a full day after my check out with no explanation.  They don‚Äôt know my life.  What if I didn‚Äôt have that to spare?

UPDATE:  Despite their reply here, they have to date never responded as to why they charged an extra night's stay after I had already checked out.  I DID hear back from Corporate (who I also contacted) who gave me enough Wyndham points for a free night's stay.","PROS:

UNAUTHORIZED CARD CHARGE,"At check in they asked for my credit card and in addition to the total cost of the stay they charged 100 dollars which they said would be refunded at checkout if there was no damage or consumption, which I already knew when booking the hotel but I consider it an unpleasant policy. At checkout, receptionist PIERRA said everything was fine but after I left, she made an unauthorized charge of 145 dollars on my card. I only realized when I was at the airport what caused me the expense and inconvenience of returning to the hotel to demand the cancellation of the undue charge, which was treated in an indifferent and unprepared manner by receptionist PIERRA. I showed the double charge on my card and she insisted that there was no mistake on the part of the hotel and refused to call the manager, stopping answering my questions completely without the minimum level of politeness to serve guests. I left, contacted the hotel and opened a complaint with booking, but in addition to not receiving a response from the hotel, on the same day I identified new charges on my card from the hotel, which is unacceptable and made me have to block the card. I TRAVEL ALL OVER THE WORLD AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEMS REGARDING THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF MY CARD, MUCH LESS SEEN THE LACK OF EDUCATION AND UNPREPAREMENT OF THE RECEPTIONIST PIERRA IN IGNORING THE GUEST'S QUESTIONS. If you don't want to have problems with your card being used inappropriately, avoid this hotel because after 3 days they still haven't responded to me. To preserve their reputation they should treat guests better and this employee PIERRA should be fired","Large room with 2 double beds, desk, closet and freezer. Location just a few blocks from Centennial Park with restaurants nearby. Large and beautiful swimming pool in the hotel's internal area.

"Awful, would never stay here again","The valet (which you‚Äôre forced to do no matter what, don‚Äôt let them lie to you) was awful, took 30 minutes to actually get someone and even when they did come to us they tried to make us go back around because we didn‚Äôt have a ticket, but no one talked to us. We had either blood or feces on the shower curtain and a few pillows that were disgusting. Hallway smelt like piss, the room was musty as all hell.

"Horribly disappointing, bordering on gross.","First, Booking.com failed to meet the low price guarantee, jerked me around for hours on the phone, failed to reply to emails and gave a bogus excuse as to why they wouldn't match the $150 less rate for my stay as it wasn't the same room, which of course, it was.  
2) the first room they put me in was wet with humidity from the pool outside the balcony, one floor down.  It also smelled of chlorine and was filthy.
3) The new room was odor free but had stains on the carpet and furniture, mildew build-up in the corners in the bathroom.
4) the halls have terribly stained carpet. 
5) they give a coupon for $10 off meals at their restaurants.  I does not specifically say that it must be redeemed with the purchase of the meal.  It says it must be applied prior to checkout, so I presented it at the front desk before I checked out and they would not apply it to my charges, telling me i had to redeem it at the restaurant with posted my charges to the bill at checkout.  (clearly not a separate entity)
6) a dog barked 1/2 the night from my original room which I was told should not even be in service due to the poor condition.
The entire hotel is in dire need of updating, yet they price it as if it were a much better hotel.  When I asked about it, the staff told me the hotel had been a converted Sheraton and was scheduled for rehab.

When customer service goes wrong...,"My recent stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing. Parking was nonexistent, and the only option was a $45 valet service that was unorganized and slower than a crock pot. The AC went out on the first night of our stay, and while they offered to refund us and book another hotel last minute, this was hardly a convenient solution for out-of-town guests.

To make matters worse, the main water pipe burst, causing chaos for businesses in the downtown area. The hotel did not inform us of this issue until later that night. Had we known earlier, we would not have checked in and settled. My wife and I were left with no choice but to order food from distant restaurants since the hotel‚Äôs restaurants were closed. They also gave us vouchers for food and drinks that we couldn't use.

In a futile attempt to make amends, they promised us two bottles of water, which never arrived despite several requests. Upon checking out, we were still charged for the entire stay, and no charges were waived. Instead, we were handed a sticky note with the manager's email because he was allegedly avoiding guests all weekend.

Called next morning again to speak to manager for adjustment to bill, on hold 30 minutes then walked downstairs.  Told by front desk they had no idea where manager was and he wasn't responding to TEAMS message but they took off the $45 valet fee and $25 destination fee....NOT close to enough for miserable stay.  Didn't even mention sink filled up 3 inches took 9 minutes to drain and room phone broken.  Not a great value as it would appear on Booking...I will NEVER stay again and advise the same.

Instead, we were told that they booked us as a no-show and they don't have a room for us unless we pay more for the remaining two nights (since the room prices have risen or something), even though we paid for one night that we did not stay at their place at all. Fortunately, the manager was able to clear this up so we didn't have to pay more. They also blocked 100 USD on my credit card as a security deposit, which I found odd. We were also using the valet parking for one night, but were charged for two nights. Adding to this chaos, we had to get new room keys after the first night because the initial ones stopped working.

Not reccomended.,"The rooms were dirty. During entire stay (8 days) my room was cleaned up only once (2nd day). I've never been in such a dirty room in a 4 star hotel. The hotel is quite old so it amplified this negative effect.
The breakfasts were very bad. No vegatables, no spices. The only tasty thing were waffles and fruits.
The view of the room was horrible - the roof with some equipment.

Just okay and not worth the price.,"The rooms AC was awful. We had it all the way down on 60 degrees and would still just sweat from sitting there. We ended up not sleeping with any blankets on us because of how hot it was. 

The bed itself was ok but not the best. It was on the harder side so we‚Äôd wake up kind of stiff. Pillows were nice at first but would go flat quick. 

Everything seemed clean although there were little hairs stuck all over the bathroom ceiling. We assumed maybe it was from a previous guest shaving? 

I think the pictures of the hotel is a little misleading. It‚Äôs very dated on the inside and is heavily deodorized with this old lady smelling perfume? I‚Äôm not sensitive to smells but I could see someone who is hating it. One thing that really annoyed us was there‚Äôs no vending machines on any of the floors and the little shop inside closes at like 10 or 11. So coming back late, you‚Äôre out of luck if you want a drink or snack. 

I would say the room was worth the initial price but once they added on the daily $45 valet charge, $25 destination fee, and $5.00 state hotel fee, plus the sales tax of 8.9% and occupancy tax of 8%, I definitely don‚Äôt think the room was worth $900 for 4 nights.

This was the worse stay I ever had at a HOTEL.,This was the worse experience I have had with an Hotel EVER!! We waited over a hour in line to check in - After completing the Pre checkin online prior to coming. To be told our room was no longer available. We were then down graded from 2 queens to one King and were advised they were going to bring a pull out bed. After hours of never receiving the bed and multiple calls to the from desk. We were then told they did not have anymore pull out to accommodate us. When went to speak to Manager about the disappointing experience he was so rude and dismissive.Saying it was nothing they could do about it. He even walked away in the middle of the conversation yelling refusing to discuss anything further.I later found out this person was the actual DIRECTOR of the hotel! UNBELIEVABLE !!!! In addition to the terrible experience the floor (9th floor ) had a very strong smell of urine !!! I have never been treated so badly at a business. I will never return to this hotel and will share my experience with anyone visiting ATL as a warning!,1 staff member and 1 security member was nice and apologetic about the RUDE & DISRESPECTFUL service I have received from the Director of this establishment. this made me feel that not all staff agreed with his approach.,1.0,March 2024,"April 4, 2024",Double Room with Two Double Beds - Non-Smoking,2,Group,7.2

I will never stay here again! Ever,"First off check in was horrible. There were so many people and teenagers in the lobby waiting to check in. When I finally got to the counter the front desk agent greeted me and asked for my id, checked me in.  Get upstairs to our room and there only one bed when I reserved a double bed. So I grabbed the phone on the nightstand to call front desk and got no answer. Not being able to reach the front desk via telephone was literally from Friday to Sunday, the whole time during my weekend stay. My cousin and I decide to just share the bed because we did not want to go back into that line downstairs. I was not informed of this change At ALL upon check in. She asked for my id and if I was using the card on file, that was it.  The inattentiveness of the staff was very upsetting.  On top of that the drainage in the shower and sink was terribly slow. We were literally in a foot of water while showering because it wasn‚Äôt draining fast enough. Sunday morning I was finally able to reach front desk and that‚Äôs only because I called from my personal phone. I was calling to request a late check out but I changed my mind mid convo because her attitude towards me once I asked questions about no one answering the phones during our whole visit.",The location of this hotel was probably the only thing I liked about it.,4.0,March 2024,"March 26, 2024",Double Room with Two Double Beds - Non-Smoking,2,Family,7.2

I/We will NEVER stay at this hotel or recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.,"The amount paid to stay for 3 nights was outragous due to all the issues we had to deal with. We were not told until arrival that we would either have to pay $45 a night for valet parking or find a parking lot somewhere around the block to park and walk, being two younger females that was a safety issue. On our second night there it rained and there was a line of vehicles trying to park or go through the valet area so we ended up waiting atleast 45 minutes and still had 4 vehicles infront of us so we ended up having to get out in the rain and walk from where we were parked. What is the point in paying valet if you have to wait that long to park and then still have to walk in the rain?  Our room stayed warm the entire time, we had the ac on the coolest setting and still it was not cool at all. Severely outdated. The door barely shut, it wiggled around alot, the deadbolt did not work either. The worst issue of all is that we were there on business and had to be up every morning at 7am yet we were not able to sleep due to people yelling and partying all night every single night (seemed to be coming from the courtyard). Quiet times were not enforced at all. I called down to the front desk multiple times before actually speaking with someone who said they would take care of it and they never did.  On saturday night it got so bad that after I called several times and was told that the security guard was going to take care of it I actually went down to the front desk in person and was told the same thing, (3 am in the morning). Smaller issues- the housekeeper came by and we told her we didnt want her to come clean until we left yet we came back from our conference and she had come in there and made up one bed and I'm not sure what else. The pool was closed on friday evening when we got back and on saturday. Breakfast was not included and was expensive. We paid $40 for 2 muffins, 2 sodas, and 2 frappes.",The day that we were checking out there was a oriental man working the valet and he was super professional and nice.

Never stay here.,"Shew, where to begin.  I'd start with, never ever stay here under any circumstances.  I'd rather sleep in my car.  But keep reading, it bets much much better.  The hotel itself is trapped in 2001, the WHOLE design and decore is so outdated it's laughable.   Brown is the main theme and color.

So let's get to the popular topic, parking.  In my 40 years I have NEVER stayed at a hotel that does not provide parking.  I don't mean the valet that's offered for 45 a day.  I mean ANY parking in general, ALL that is available and offered is their valet, for 45 a day.... If you want to use valet, they tell you there is a lot across the street that isn't operated by the hotel.  There's a sign that says 18 to park, now that's a TOTAL lie.  I parked my car just past midnight, left out the next morning around 10am, 22 dollars.  Parked there for 10 hours, 22 dollars.... Oh it gets better.  They also inform that there's a huge homeless problem and they like to stay inside the parking deck, so don't leave anything inside because your car might get broken into....that's not all!  They like to use the stairs as a TOILET.  The smell of urine and poop, really nice. So to avoid the stairs we will attempt the elevator, it doesn't work, which was probably a gift from God.  I can only imagine how terrible the inside of the elevator would be.

As I am writing this I find a nice big brown mystery stain on my comforter the hotel provides (pic included, praise Jesus we leave in the morning).  Went to warm up some food we had leftover from supper, oh there's not a microwave.  The 11th floor hallways has this odor of cologne stored in a colostomy bag.   The remote to the TV works when it wants to, but that's ok because you can download an app that you can use your phone as a remote, but good luck finding one that works with the TV.

This place is amateur hour at best and pathetic at worst.",The only redeeming quality of this hotel was the pool area was nice.,2.0,March 2024,"March 6, 2024",Deluxe Queen Room with Two Queen Beds - Non-Smoking,2,Couple,7.2
Great value for money; where the little details and lovely customer care made the stay delightful,I don't have many dislikes besides the fact that there wasn't much of a view (or their was but it wasn't great) which isn't a deal breaker and in some regard the hotel design felt a little dated,"10/10 for the customer care and awareness! The original room I booked wasn't ready when I arrived so I called reception and they gave me a different room immediately and with such pleasantries that you would definitely want after a long trip. Linda at the front desk was very helpful and genuine, it made me a whole lot more comfortable when you get service with a smile and conversation that makes it easy to ask if you needed anything. 

I absolutely loved the food (especially the cornbread which the chef makes fresh) from the restaurant. The service was spectacular, and Patricia at the bar was a delight, so down to earth and smiley. 

The bed was super comfy, and there were more than enough towels and basic toiletries provided. Although I didn't bring my swimsuit to take a dip, the pool area was a lovely hang out

The location was great too! Even though a lot of people drive or have access to a car in Atlanta, I feel there were some great food places, attractions and transport all within walking distance- and very helpful that without traffic the airport is literally 15-20minutes away

BUSINESS / CONFERENCE TRAVELERS - AVOID!!! They have refused to give me a receipt for months now.,"The primary issue I experienced was a lack of any service/follow-up after checking out, as many other reviewers have mentioned. I had zero issues with checking in or paying my bill - the Courtland Grand was more than happy to take my money (over $600, as I stayed several nights for the APHA conference). I paid for the hotel using my personal credit card, as I do not have access to a corporate card. 

I used the contactless checkout system (dropped my key into the dropbox), as I was in a hurry on the last morning of the conference to get to my session and catch my flight home. I assumed (incorrectly) that I would receive some sort of confirmation afterwards that I had checked out and that my account was settled - especially since the hotel had charged several additional fees and a damage deposit hold to my credit card. However, I never received anything like that from the Courtland Grand.

Fast forward three months, and I am still waiting for the hotel to issue me a receipt. I have called the Billing Department and left numerous messages. I called the front desk, and they told me no one was available to help me. I was given an email address for the Reservations Department, which I have contacted multiple times. I have yet to receive any response. Subsequent attempts to contact the front desk / main hotel line have gone unanswered, or the phone just rings and then goes back to the main menu options. It's honestly ridiculous at this point, and I have resorted to posting this review and filing a BBB complaint, because I have no way of receiving reimbursement from my employer without the receipt.","I actually enjoyed staying here - yes, the rooms are pretty outdated, but it was clean enough for me, and the indoor pool was great (stayed in November 2023).",3.0,November 2023,"February 6, 2024",King Room - Non-Smoking,4,Solo traveler,7.2

Poor,"Hotel is extremely dated and the furniture looks tired. The building looks like an auto shop or something - just not very inviting or cared for. Value - the hotel charges a 'resort' fee, which I think is just a huge scam that hotels have come up with. No one also ever mentions this to you - there is simply a sign at check in that I assume the hotel apparently has to put there, but no one ever says a word about it. In the end, you are simply presented with the bill. The hotel also sends an email before check in letting you know that due to covid, the rooms are not cleaned during the first three nights of your stay. Lastly - everything in the room for daily use is single-use plastic. The cups in the bathroom, coffee cups, the things you need for the coffee maker - everything plastic. Why not put real glasses in the room, coffee mugs, and coffee machines that do not produce so much plastic trash? And another point - the hotel seems understaffed. There was a huge check out line at 8 am in the morning, and only one person on duty.","Staff was overall friendly, breakfast was nice - very attentive staff, good food options, good coffee.

Be clear as to what you're getting,"A very big hotel with very few staff.  Feels a bit like a ghost town walking around.

Again  I hiked down to Reception to ask if my room should have been serviced (it wasn't) and was told that it is only done every 3rd day! 
Was on 7th floor and there seemed to be little sound insulation against noise from the street. 
Was surprised to be charged an additional $24+ per day for,I think,'Discretionary Services'. I have no idea what this charge was for and had not known previously that this charge would be made.

Avoid it. I will say no more.,"I chose for this hotel since it was shown on the top of the property list. I don't blame the Booking.com system but I must say I made a poor choice. The hotel is very debilitated and shabby. Don't fool yourselves with the description of ""by XXX"". The check-in receptionist was exceptionally unwelcoming. She did seem she had zero enthusiasm in her profession. Good lick with that. My room was located on the other side of the building and I had to pass so many corridors. I thought three star hotel in Las Vegas was the worst. Well. I was wrong. You can here all the noises from adjacent rooms. The room was not cleaned thoroughly. As you can see in the attached photo, there was a cigarette butt. Now I understand why there were so many signs and warning message of charging for smoking. Yet, I paid over 200 USD for this. I had so many good memories in Atlanta Downtown. But not this. PS: When I checked out,, I showed its picture to the receptionist.

Very basic,"Really overpriced for what you get. I travel a couple times per month and have never stayed somewhere they don't clean the rooms daily (this makes it like an airbnb not a hotel). They said they do it every 3 days but then sent me a message saying to pick my requests, of which one of the options was 'free room cleaning' and then I got a message the next day saying request denied (so why send it?) They alao really want you out of there - on the last day I had a wake up call I did not request at 6am and then a text asking when I was checking out. I chose 12pm which is the standard, but someone then came to my room asking when I was checking out at 10am. Not really sure what the motivation is behind sending you all these texts they have no intention of following.

My room card scanner was not working. I had to come back to the reception three times with my 52 lbs backpack. There was no luggage stroller in sight. Nice staff at the front desk called engineering to fix my door. I waited for 25 minutes and nothing happened. Finally they gave me another room, but I waited 45 minutes in total to be able to enter the room.

Breakfast wasn't very good, no veggie in sight, artificial scrambled eggs. The front desk told me wrong price for the breakfast. 

My room was cold, the AC controller was not working (I set it to 77 degrees and the air coming out of the vent only got colder and colder)

TV wasn't working

No hotel book in the room, supposedly the information should be on the tv, but nothing worked, everytime there was error alert. So no way of knowing what are the opening times of the facilities, no possibility to order food or any other service. No information on how to contact the front desk. 

Empty fridge while 100 usd incidental is taken and justified by the fact that it can pay for what you take from the minibar...interesting.

The hotel charged me more than my price listed here on booking + the 100 usd inicdental. I have checked out today and I am expecting my refund very soon and in correct amount.

IT WAS CLEAN BUT NOT ANYWHERE I WILL STAY AGAIN.,First off my booking came with parking and all. I get there I wasn‚Äôt allowed to park free as supposed. I paid $15 for two minutes across the street. The front desk lady that was speaking with me was very rude and just constantly spoke with her head side ways like she was already irritated. Several others kept saying but they told me that I didn‚Äôt need risk bands for swimming. My refrigerator in the room didn‚Äôt work. I was beyond pissed that I had to park across the road to park when it‚Äôs a whole parking deck for the hotel but the man out front said it vallet parking ONLY $45 a night. Once you there you stuck unless you walking or can afford to keep paying $15 every time. Breakfast supposed to come with my purchase but it wasn‚Äôt any breakfast.

Mold,"The hotel was very old and not well maintained. Upon arrival the room smelled like mold and the carpet floor was wet. The room itself was damp. Walls, bedding and windows. We called the front desk to let them know. They made us pack up everything and come down to the front desk to Turn In keys to move us to a room two doors down. When we got in the second room it was the EXACT same thing. Mold smell, wet floor with condensation all over. The only difference was this room had an broken  A/C unit. It ran all day and night on 60 degrees. At this point we were running late to our destination so we just changed our clothes and left.

Would not recommend.,"We were given a room that was wayyyyy out.  First, the desk attendant, who was new,  told us we were in the south tower.  We could not find our room.  We finally gave up and went to the desk and asked.   We were advised we were in the north tower.   Okay.   

We walked for what seemed like forever (I walk five miles a day, so it‚Äôs not like I couldn‚Äôt handle the walk, but I‚Äôm tired, I‚Äôve got carry ons, and I just want to get to my room).   We finally get there - card is keyed incorrectly.   We can‚Äôt get in.  

Walk all the way back to the front desk.   A different desk attendant helps me.   I say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre off to a bad start.   First we‚Äôre told the wrong tower, now the key doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù.   She types something in (wordless), rekeys a card, and hands it go me.    No ‚ÄúGee, sorry,‚Äù nothing.  As we were walking away, my daughter heard her comment on my ‚Äúattitude‚Äù.   

Later on, we asked the woman in the gift shop if she had scissors we could borrow to cut off a tag.   She pointed to a bunch of boxes and said ‚ÄúBy the freezer‚Äù.  What?  ‚ÄúIn the boxes, by the freezer‚Äù.   We walked over to all these boxes.  I didn‚Äôt see any scissors, nor did my daughter.   We shrugged our shoulders and walked out.  The woman yelled ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt find them?   Did you find them?!  Get back here!!!!‚Äù

Nightmare in Atlanta for tons of dollars....,"It was a nightmare.
1. Arrive to the location around midnight and door was closed, 5 customer is waiting outside to let us in. After 10 minutes another customer let us in. (because ringing continuously).. Valet night shift is our place and watching that we are waiting at the door!
2. After we get in, approx 50 feet line is waiting for us with approx 40 people on the line are waiting to check-in. After 2 hours waiting I can get in my room... by the way the associate who was alone should open the door to let the new customers in but the phone is ringing beside her and she didn't take care of them... (just a second)
3. extremely tiny road to drive parking on the building, and you need to take care of pedestrians who walking back to the hotel at the side of the super tiny road... The walking way has been separated from the driveway but if the front of the car hits thats place as well when you taking turn...
4. The main door to enter hotel from the parking lot was out of order and we need to walk around and take detour in the really cold parking place to get in on the main entrance, Spoke with other customer who said nobody will fix it because wallet can't make money.
5. Room looks okay but the bed wasn't pretty comfortable.
6. I put on the online checking (what didn't work that's why I had to stayed on the line almost 2 hours) I don't want housekeeping  during my stay but they came every day. The best things that they got  touch, close and moved my McBook pro out and put on the top of the case where it could slide down to the ground (!!!!!!!), hopefully not... , touched other my belonging on the bathroom.. and the best... they didn't refill the washing soap on the shower and leave paper tissue almost rolled up.. I am not qualified that but if they came in without authorization that's okay for me (but I don't think so it can work for others) BUT they touched my belonging and make unsafe situation because of my laptop..","Just the location, nothing more.

Superb,"Nothing bad to say, but I will address some stuff that others said that I found to be true.
-Someone commented on a chemical smell in the hallway that was probably caused by cleaning supplies. I found this to be true when I first checked in. But I am not sensitive to scents. Also, I never smelled that odor again after Day 1.
-Many people commented on outdated hotel decor. I found the lobby and main floor to be very modern, but yes the room decor was outdated. But that doesn‚Äôt personally bother me. My room had a bed and not one, but two chairs! It had everything that I needed such as a mini fridge, blow dryer and iron + ironing board. The bed was also very comfy.
-Someone said the thermostat didn‚Äôt work. I had 0 issues with the thermostat. But I am a person who is usually cold. So the first thing I do when I check into hotels is turn the thermostat up. I did not use the air conditioning at all during my stay, only heat.
-Many people said that check-out was difficult and there was a long line. I had 0 issues. There was almost never more than 2 people in line any time I went to the front desk. They also have boxes placed throughout the main floor where you can stick your keycard in. No need to go to the front desk and check-out
-Some people stated that the pool was closed. The pool was open during my stay November 29 - December 1, 2022. I used the pool and greatly enjoyed it. The pool is indoors and is heated.
-Many people commented on elevators not working. All of the elevators were working during my stay.
-Some people commented on noise from the bar across the street. Perhaps because I stayed during the weekday and not the weekend, the bar across the street was never even open. I did not hear a lot of noise from the street. I was on the 9th floor.
-I think the only thing that can be improved would be adding in machines where we can refill water containers. They have water fountains by the main floor bathroom and also by the gym.","Superb stay! Absolutely no complaints on my end. I saw so many bad reviews on here and on Google. To the point where I became afraid to stay here but it was already too late to cancel my booking and be refunded. So I went ahead with my booking and I‚Äôm very glad that I did. I had 0 issues with this hotel. I would definitely stay here again and also recommend it to others. I am not the kind of person who eats at hotels. And I have worked at hotels both in the US and UK. But I don‚Äôt travel to eat hotel food. I travel in order to try the local restaurants. So I can not comment on that. But I will try to address all of the other comments that I read.

"Nice hotel, but some small issues","The club across the street was BLARING music until midnight.   Every few minutes a loud song would start up. It kept us awake after our long day on the road. Be aware that it doesn't stop until midnight on Sundays and later on other nights. We were in room 330.  Maybe if you were higher up or father back it wouldn't be as loud (?). The lobby is pretty but we noticed there was a bad smell every time we entered .  There was little to no ventilation in the bathroom, so it took a really long time for the mirror to clear after showers.  This made it difficult to apply make up in a timely manner.  The Starbucks was a complete joke. The two employees who were trying to fill in for whoever actually worked there had no idea how to make a hot latte OR an iced cappuccino.  It took 20 minutes for them to make what we asked for and even then it was wrong.  They were nice, but not knowledgeable.  There was not enough creamer in the room for the coffee provided, plus the lids didn't fit the coffee cups.","Clean rooms, comfy beds, nice sheets and pillows. Lovely view. Friendly check in staff.

Nice staff.  Seedy area.  Not coming back.,"Safety / security.  Open amenities (lounges, bars, restaurants, hot tub).  Refresh decor.","We did not pay an extraordinary amount for this room ($130/night + taxes) but we would never stay here again. The location is rough. We were panhandled almost literally inside the valet lobby this morning while waiting for our car (the man came right to the opened sliding door). There are homeless literally on the property and all around the block that the hotel occupies. We walked a block over to a Subway / Waffle House and immediately turned around because of the presence of homeless / loiterers near the restaurant doors.  A seedy liquor store is directly across the street, vacant storefronts are immediately across the street and this feels to be just a generally run down area. Not what I expected for such a name brand chain hotel. 

I fully understand that some of this does not reflect directly in the hotel but rather larger circumstances In all major cities today.  I am sympathetic to those in the situation but I also want to feel safe and secure when in a city 1,000 miles away from home.  I actually feel badly for the hotel because the surroundings are clearly hurting business here.  

The building itself was relatively clean but very ""tired"" in terms of decor. Could use an overhaul. Most of the amenities were closed, including all of the restaurants.  Breakfast buffet was open for $25 (including tax + tip) per person and some of the food had already run out by the time we came down around 8:30.  Eggs / sausage / bacon / bread options / oatmeal.  Cold coffee.  Limited tea.  There were no spoons for whatever reason.

The room itself was a bit small (one queen bed and shared microwave in hallway near the elevator).  Musty smell throughout.  The air conditioning unit made a loud ""ticking"" noise all night long. 

The staff is very friendly!!  Everyone greeted us promptly with a smile and / or ""hello.""  Everyone was very helpful and cordial.

I asked if we could at least get cleaning supplies. We had to wait 30 minutes and by then it was 12:30am and my husband had to clean it.  The next day they did comp our two nights after we gave our stay a 5 ( pretty generous) on the text messaging  they communicate with their customers on. Someone in management called our room to apologize. That was good. 

Our second night, there were several rooms that we‚Äôre gathering in the hallway to continue their gathering from where ever they came from.  It was a group of young men and they we‚Äôre intoxicated. I utilized the text messaging to ask for assistance. Security came in about twenty minutes. It was about 12:45am by then. Once security left, they came back out in the hallway to continue the party. I utilized the text messaging again. They said security would monitor the hallway for an hour to make sure they did not come back out. Security did not monitor because the group came out again. This went on into 1:45.",The bathrooms were newly remodeled,3.0,August 2022,"August 12, 2022","Guest room, 2 Double",2,Family,7.2

Very Poor,"My husband and I frequent quite a few Sheraton Hotels and this location was a total surprise.  We stayed in room 953.  It was right across from the elevator and it seemed as though it was initially a storage room. There was a microwave located in the hallway which reminded me of being in college.  With this hotel being located in Downtown Atlanta, I expected more, but unfortunately, this hotel fell flat.  The hotel also attracted a more rowdy urban crowd.  Lastly, the parking was located at the hotel, but the walk was long to get to the hotel itself.

Berbat bir konaklama ge√ßirdim,"First of all, I would like to say that I had a terrible stay. Because some of the negativities in your facility made me very sad.
1.After 12 hours of air travel, I reached the facility and went to bed. My wife and child said that after I went to bed, our door was tried to be opened and other doors were opened and closed. On the 2nd day, while I was awake, the sound of doors opening and closing in the corridor started to come again, at 1 am, sometimes at 5 am. On the 3rd day, I couldn't stand it and opened the door and a binladin type employee was opening the doors with a note in his hand. When I asked what he was doing, he said he didn't understand. The mirror is cleaning the staff pool. And my 8-year-old daughter was frightened by these sounds and knocking on the door and she couldn't even go to the toilet. On the 3rd day, my daughter said she saw an insect at the bottom of the TV, I immediately ran and caught the insect and killed it. It was a cockroach with antennae. I took the picture too. I will if you want. In the light of this information, I would like to express the following to you, since I have not been a hotelier and tourism operator for 20 years.

Advise your employee not to disturb people by making noise and probing room doors. Give him a house keeping report and an in house report so he can know if the room is empty. Do not force the door.
Spray the rooms. It is not right to share the room with insects and other creatures.
And in the light of these two informations, I think that you do not take precautions for diseases such as legionella. I felt the runway in your air conditioners. Clean them periodically.

It was an okay stay. Not worth what we spent.,There were multiple things wrong with this hotel. My hotel door was jammed and hard to close. I literally had to push hard on the door to get it to close. The rooms are small and had a bad smell. You don‚Äôt have a lot of space to move around and they look a little run down like they tried to make it look nice. My coworker had a big hole in her bathroom ceiling by the shower and had to switch rooms. They tried to double charge my other coworker and charge him for the amount of 3 rooms! It took him 3 days to get everything handled and they tried to say he did get 3 rooms with valet parking but he had already paid for his room  days before we got there and he rode with me and we did not have to pay the hotel for parking. Valet let us pay them instead because the hotel charges a lot to park. Locating which side your room was on was also a bit confusing. The club and bar was not open. You had to pay for WiFi and it didn‚Äôt work much. It would be nice to also have a book or menu of the times the restaurant opens and close in your room. Also a book of nearby restaurants.,I liked the pool and gift shops. The room view was nice even though it was a lot of construction. The employees were nice.
