Would definitely recommend!,"Nothing to report, everything was great. Just make sure you do your research, as there are no restaurants nearby - we were aware of this in advance, so it wasn’t a problem. It was always a nice evening walk to the city centre.","Great, clean and quiet hotel. It’s located just a short walk from Praia de Porto Mós, which was our favourite beach in whole Lagos. Breakfast in the hotel is simple but really tasty, everything is fresh, the staff is attentive and friendly. Lovely pool with sun loungers and a bar, plenty of space for everyone and you could always find a spot. The bar staff were great, taking care of everyone, checking in and serving tasty drinks. The hotel is slightly away from the city centre, which was perfect for us, as we were looking for a place away from the city noise and crowds. 
When we were checking out and our flight home was late in the evening, we were able to leave our luggage and still use the pool and facilities which was amazing and we really appreciated it! Special shoutout to Amin from breakfast who was always chatting to us in the morning, and Jose (plus another young guy whose name we didn’t catch!) from bar staff, always putting a smile on our faces and making a great iced latte!",10,August 2024,"August 7, 2024",Twin Room,7,Couple,9.1
Exceptional,"Pool is very nice here, but pool service was a bit slow and ""clunky"" - ran out of a few items. But the staff was very sweet and I had a great Mojito at the pool bar!","We had the most amazing room with a huge balcony with hot tub! Breakfast was quite good and had a great latte/cappuccino machine. We originally had to leave early for an excursion, and realized breakfast was not served until after we had to leave. The manager made sure to have the breakfast staff prepare continental items and they brought pastries, milk, cereals, etc to our room the evening before. So nice of them! good location to Old Town Lagos - only a 5 minute Uber ride. We loved Old Town Lagos.",10,July 2024,"August 7, 2024",Superior Queen Room,2,Family,9.1
Lovely hotel in Lagos,"The pool bar could have had a wider menu. 
It is little far from Lagos old town - but we took taxis which were very affordable.","Beautiful hotel - stylishly decorated,  clean and modern. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The swimming pool was clean and the perfect cool temperature. We had a fantastic room on 2 levels with 2 x twin beds and a double bed. The breakfast was delicious with lots of fresh fruit, bread,  pastries, cake, fresh meat and cheese and eggs cooked to order. 
The hotel is a 10min walk to a vast, stunning beach with 2 restaurants (you need to book ahead).",9.0,August 2024,"August 4, 2024",Duplex Room,5,Family,9.1
Outstanding stay!,No hair conditioner but that is minor.

Outstanding - we’d love to go back one day!,,"We loved our time at this hotel!! It was clean, modern, great pool, lots of breakfast options hot and cold but what really made it for us were the staff - from the first person we met on Reception (Joao) to Amin at breakfast (and the girls!) to Thiago and Jose at the bar, everyone was so helpful and kind. It really felt like a family run hotel and we never felt like we were just a number. The hotel is outside the main town of Lagos but we liked that as it was very peaceful. It was a 20-25 minute walk into the main town where there were lovely places to eat (in the old town). The hotel is very close to the sandy beaches too but in the end we preferred to swim in the pool - there was always a lounger free and because the hotel isn’t huge, the pool area was never packed. We were in room 11, which was above the reception and although it was essentially overlooking the small car park with the pool to the left, the view when you sat down on the balcony was out to the sea - perfect for a quiet early morning read!",10,July 2024,"August 1, 2024",Standard Queen Room,9,Couple,9.1

"We really enjoyed our stay in the Atlantic Hotel and would definitely go back,","Only one unisex loo around pool area,  Pool bar music could get a little loud depending on who was manning the bar, so even listening to music with my earpods didn't block it out.  But most of the time it was at a reasonable level.  Also, Bathrooms off the hotel rooms have glass door and upper part of the wall separating bathroom/shower from the main bedroom is glass also, so privacy may be in issue for some.","Pool area was nice and quite with beds available at all times, staff were very friendly, everything was really nice.

The breakfast exceeded our expectations as well, as we weren’t sure what to expect and had stayed at a few hotels along our trip that included breakfast, but this was the best by far. The location worked perfect for us, although if you don’t have a car or a way to get into the town, it wouldn’t be ideal as walking would be too far.

"As a common person, not having stayed in the most luxurious hotels, I can see that this facility gave me that feeling of",The gravel in the parking lot kept getting trapped in the grip of my tennis shoes.,"On approach the property wasn’t remarkable, however as we explored throughout the hotel the craftsmanship, decor choices and astonishing murals and art pieces were awe inspiring. The tile work throughout the property lifted our spirits of elegance, quality and value. It made us feel like the owner understood how to emerge his customers into a feeling of ultimate satisfaction and treasures. Every time we left our room we couldn’t help but noticing the love we had for our surroundings and how a small 31 room hotel could be so beautiful. Breakfast was amazing, which included eggs made to order, hot items like local sausage and ham with roasted vegetables, beans, mushrooms and boiled eggs the selection kept us returning each morning. It’s mind boggling how this small hotel had so much additional items to offer for breakfast like a cold bar with 3 kinds of cheeses, 4 kinds of deli meats, sliced tomatoes, sliced beets, sliced cucumbers and breads to be toasted. The food choices just continues with fresh fruits and a pastry bar that changed each day with mouth watering quiche, cakes and other desserts. The entire staff from front desk, cleaning,bar and Francieli in the dining area were great and very attentive to our needs. Francieli greeted us each morning noting if I wanted 3 fried eggs, which I truly enjoyed.",10,November 2023,"December 1, 2023",Deluxe Double Room with Sea View,4,Couple,9.1

There are also two restaurants near by with great local food and nice cocktails. The staff (Amin and Mayara) in the breakfast area and Mathilde at the bar were super.

4 star hotel stay with corporate service,"I booked this solo stay at this 4 star as a gift to myself for my birthday, and indicated the same to the property. Although I am not entitled to it, and the hotel is not obligated, I was expecting a 4 star hotel (that was relatively empty and uncrowded) to atleast acknowledge it. Client orientation could be better for this reason, and the corporate vibe lacks a certain warmth of stay. But I highly rate the cleaning staff and restaurant chef!","The best room out of my entire Portugal trip! Amazingly spacious with beautiful decor and facilities including coffee machine.

"Bright, clean, stylish with a great breakfast","I think I chose the wrong type of room. It was an apartment and unfortunately had practically no natural light. The limited windows were also close to a walkway and hotel workers seemed to be constantly outside, meaning limited privacy. The reception was closed for the night and there was no proper restaurant in the evening, just a place to get snacks. There were a few restaurants within 10 minutes walking distance but most were a couple of km away. Not in my view a 4-star overall epxerience.","I arrived early and they were able to accommodate me, which was very nice. The room was large, with a kitchen.

Completely lovely hotel with great amenities and excellent comfort and value.,"There is construction *right next door* and the view is a bit off-putting, yet fascinating to my husband who is in the building industry back home and he enjoyed watching it every day. The front desk woman on the day we arrived at noon wasn't helpful or nice. She stated aloud angrily that ""planes keep arriving earlier and earlier."" Well, there's not much we can do about when the plane lands, and we weren't demanding our room be ready - only asked to have our luggage secured so we could go and enjoy the day. We are well aware of check-in times, and travel abroad frequently, and yet, as our first encounter with your hotel brand, her interaction was terribly off-putting. We even discussed switching hotels. Instead, we tried to avoid her the remainder of the trip after checking in officially with Samuel at 4 pm and having a lovely experience with him. I wish I knew her name because there's another woman at the front desk who was nice. If a hotel brand is not open to tourists who arrive with all their metaphorical and literal baggage, what then is your business exactly? Thankfully she was mere blemish on a rather perfect week at the hotel.",The included breakfast was exceptional and the staff at the breakfast room were sweet and helpful each day. The room was well equipped and serviced regularly. The location of the hotel was easy enough to get around by uber or taxi and the proximity to the beach was lovely. Samuel at the front desk was amazingly friendly and helpful - a nice smile and chat at the end of a busy day.,10,October 2023,"October 26, 2023",Deluxe Double Room with Balcony and Sea View,7,Family,9.1

The salt water pool was very nice and refreshing, with many lounge chairs to be able to sit and relax. The pool side bar and staff were fantastic - plenty of times we ordered snacks which were reasonably priced and sat by the pool instead of making the trek out to the old town.

Breakfast was included daily and had all of the essentials to start the day off right.

The location is a 5 minute walk from the beach (Praia de Porto Mos) which was incredible. The sand was fine, there was no seaweed on the ground and one of the nicest beaches we saw while in Lagos. It is a bit further away from the old town, which is quiet at night, but would recommend a car if you are planning on staying here as you can easily find free parking close to the old town to save from walking.",10,October 2023,"October 7, 2023",Deluxe Queen Room,4,Couple,9.1

"Wonderful, relaxing, great value. Would stay again without question.","A few small complaints. 1. For whatever reason the cleaning crew did not seem to want us to have towels? After the first night, they only gave us one new towel, but took away the rest, even though our room comes with a jacuzzi and would need more than other rooms. On the third night we grabbed extra towels from the lobby to only be taken back from the cleaning staff during turndown? Seemed odd, but not a deal breaker. 2. This is minor, but the modern bathroom has large frosted glass wall facing the bed, which looks really cool, until the middle of the night when your partner has to use the bathroom and has to turn on a light in the bathroom. (Could easily be fixed with a nightlight or dimmable lights in the bathroom) With the entire room being marble floors, we could hear the people above us coming in around midnight. It wasn't super loud, but noticeable","Wonderfull hotel. Staff was attentive, courteous and nice. Our room was very big, clean and had plenty of amenities. Very modern looking with a comfy bed and marble floors. Ask for room 100 it comes with a private 2 person jacuzzi on a large balcony overlooking a pretty good view of the ocean.

Very nice stay - we would recommend the hotel!,"Only 3 minor things to mention: (1) Our room had a ""see-through-shower"" which itself is not a problem, but you could see the toilet through that semi-transparent window as well, which we did not like. (2) Construction site next to the building which will certainly last for anther couple of month. However, as we have been exploring the area outside the hotel during the days, it has not disturbed us much.

Beautiful views but rooms not what we had expected.,"We were given rooms with access outside and upstairs to a small, quite narrow and dangerous entranceway to the room. Although the rooms were lovely and comfortable, we would have appreciated knowing how  
inaccessible these rooms were for our +80 year old mother. When we booked we had asked if the hotel had an elevator and they said they had. The hotel should have told us ahead of time that our rooms would not only be non-accessible by elevator, but that there were stairs required and a narrow steep ledge at the top of the stairs where the door to the room must be unlocked and then a heavy sliding glass door to pull open into the the room. These rooms are not easily accessible and are dangerous for the elderly, young children, and those with disabilities.","Gorgeous location, comfortable beds, clean, beautiful view, nice breakfast included with lots of staff, cafe and bar open until 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm respectively, family friendly hotel, outdoor pool, free parking, drinking water machine at front desk",9.0,October 2022,"October 13, 2022",King Room with Sea View,1,Family,9.1

Good for a short stay,The location requires you to have a car to visit Lagos. There are two places to eat within walking distance which can be boring if you are staying more than 2 days. There is construction going on next to the hotel which can spoil an otherwise nice view.,The room and bath were spacious and modern and very clean. Rooms vary considerably so you need to be sure you specify what you would like. We asked for a sea view room on a top floor with a nice balcony. Unfortunately we got the smallest balcony in the hotel and we could not be moved to another room. Only 2 rooms have this small balcony. The sea view from the room also overlooks construction next door. We were staying 5 days. We were told people with shorter stays get better rooms?? The pool area was very nice and the pool is not heated. The breakfast buffet was excellent with choice of eggs made to order. There is a bartender for drinks and light meals.

Nice place to say particularly for couples who would like to lounge by the pool!,"The location was a bit out of the way so we had quite a walk into the busier section and into historic Lagos (about a 20 minute walk).   You can Uber however at pretty low cost.   Also, in the list of facilities, it mentions laundry service but they do not currently offer that.  My recommendation to the facility is to sticker over that section (don't expect you to go to the cost of re-printing the entire guide) as they do not actually offer it and the front desk person seemed clueless to the fact that the amenities list in the rooms did indeed mention this.","Overall, the room was very nicely appointed and comfortable.    The bathroom was nicely set up and no complaints there.   The room itself was quite spacious with a couch (which was pull out so you could accommodate someone else there as well).   The main bed was quite comfortable.     The coffee maker was of good quality as was the coffee.  The balcony was a nice touch although the view was hampered a bit by construction going on next door however we would see the ocean off in the distance which was nice.    The AC worked well (a really important thing to me as like to be cool).    The breakfast was not bad (one can't expect too much excitement for included breakfasts in my opinion).   They have a nice little bar with snacks that is open until about 10 pm outside the pool.  The pool was nice (pretty chilly but good on hot days) and there is a gym if you really need it :).

"Lovely location, nice rooms and facilities, and a relaxing atmosphere","A slightly bigger range of cooked foods might be nice, but the breakfast was still overall quite good. Although the gym was good and the equipment quite new, as a long time fitness enthusiast I found it a little confusing that there were a lot of cable machines with pulleys at the same level so the range of exercises was limited and the bench was at a very severe angle. Also be aware that there are only a couple of restaurants in walking distance so you will need to book, especially in the height of the season.","The staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good and even had some gluten free options, which is rare in Europe. The gym was brand new with a good range of equipment.

Found the bigger meals a little less appealing stick to snacks if going. Gym is quite small but is adequate when on holidays. Some of the drinks at the bar were fairly basic and you are paying higher prices. Can get better cocktails in town for a lot cheaper, however expect to pay higher price at a hotel anywhere rather than in town.

"Great hotel and would stay again, but could have made slightly more effort","Asked for an early breakfast / to take a small snack, as we needed to leave before 8am to catch our return flight. Were told this wasn't possible.
Told reception in advance that we were on honeymoon but no extra nice touches provided. Other hotel we stayed at in the Algarve provided a complimentary bottle of wine.
Pool is quite small (for actual swimming) and shallow.
Next door to a building site, which was fine for us but would be helpful to include this information on the listing so that people are aware.","Pretty looking hotel with a nice small feel.
Very clean and tidy.
Plenty of car parking.
Friendly reception and pool area staff.

Amazing stay in a quiet area close to Lagos,"The pool cocktails were terrible. Couldn’t taste the alcohol in them and the margarita was particularly disgusting.
AC is needed in the gym as it was hotter inside than out!","Loved this hotel and we were very pleased we chose it. It’s only 29 rooms but feels like a larger hotel as the breakfast room is large and bright, and the pool is a good size. Few rooms means there was always a sun bed spare by the pool.

The one bad thing about this hotel is that the poolside cocktails were truly awful. Just don’t bother. But otherwise everything else was amazing!

We booked the last room available which was a twin but with the beds pushed together it felt like a very large double and super comfy. Room is a good size if a little dark as only one window, AC works very well and the bathroom was beautiful (rain shower was very welcome!) 

Breakfast was really good and very consistent, even towards the end there was plenty left despite the hotel being full. Eggs cooked to order were delicious and staff friendly and accommodating. They have fresh fruit and also lots of vegan options, including flavoured soy milks which was awesome. One morning the pancakes were vegan which was a welcome addition!

It’s about a 25 minute walk to the rocky beaches and the main part of Lagos so be prepared to walk that to get to most restaurants etc. Ubers were very cheap though so we used those a few times. There is a sandy  beach 5 minutes away which is nice.

Great they have a gym but it’s a glass room on the rooftop with no AC so it’s a greenhouse to work out in. Pool is salt water and fairly cold but in the Algarve summer heat it’s very nice.

"Excellent quality hotel, but make sure the location is right for you","The hotel is not in a particularly attractive or convenient location. The immediate area is still being constructed and is currently a building site. There are no facilities nearby, another than a couple of bar/restaurants on the beach, it's in a rather Bland urbanisation full of private villas. It is a good 30 minutes walk into Lagos and it isn't an interesting walk.","The hotel itself is excellent, really good quality accommodation (we had a superb spacious duplex ideal for two teenagers). The breakfast is also excellent, a really good selection including freshly prepared fruit and proper Nespresso coffee. The pool is good too, always enough sunbeds.

Very Good,"there are better hotels in the region for that price, not really worth.

The couch in our room seemed broken and the tv remote was dirty and the hotel seemed not to be managed by a experienced management team who puts at the first place the experience  and satisfaction of their guests.

I booked 1 room with the king size bed, and one room with the single beds.
Twice I messaged the property to confirm this and they replied. Below was the reply I was sent over the message on booking.com from the hotel weeks before:

Dear Guest,

Our King Rooms with Sea View are composed of the following: 1 king-size bed OR 2 twin beds, sofa, wardrobe, desk, center table and a bathroom with shower. The rooms also offer an excellent balcony, where there is a table, chairs and sun beds to enjoy the sea view. There’s also air conditioning, minibar, satellite TV, free WI-FI, hairdryer and a laptop safe.

Looking forward to welcoming you,

Kind regards,
LAH TEAM

However upon arrival this was not the case - we had 2 rooms with king size beds and a couch bed made up in one of the rooms.
The receptionist on arrival on the 25/09 simply said to me that I should not have been told this as it was in error, despite me showing him the message on my app. In fact he told me there were no rooms with single beds of this room type (which i discovered the next day there actually are....)
He didn't even offer us an apology when i told him this is not what I'd paid for and was not what was confirmed by the hotel.
In fact he didn't offer anything in terms of some sort of compensation for the error - not even a bottle of water.
He simply shrugged and said it was an error.

So we took the rooms, having paid for it in full already and with little choice at 730 in the evening.

Having slept in the couch bed I didn't sleep at all - I was too tall (in fact all of us were too tall) for the couch bed.
Given the price of the hotel this is not what I'd expect for this price point and what you would expect of a hotel of this stature.","Nice hotel, close to beach, lovely pool area",3.0,September 2023,"September 27, 2023",King Room with Sea View,1,Group,9.1

- loud reconstruction near the hotel, that spoiled the view from the terrace
The refrigerator in our room was broken and produced extremely loud sounds.
Upon our arrival, we were immediately greeted by the overwhelming noise coming from the fridge. Concerned about our comfort, we approached the administrator and requested either a room change or a replacement fridge. Disappointingly, she informed us that all apartments had the same issue.

Persisting with our request, we asked for a thorough inspection, hoping for a resolution. However, the administrator adamantly insisted that it was impossible to address the problem and assured us that it was a common occurrence across all apartments.

Left with no other choice, we reluctantly decided to pay for an additional apartment to verify if the issue was genuinely present in all units. To our surprise, when we checked the alternative apartment, the fridge was completely silent.

It became evident that the administrator had lied to us and simply refused to provide any viable solutions to rectify the problem. This unprofessional and non-client-oriented behavior was highly disappointing.

Overall, our experience at the hotel was marred by this incident. The lack of concern and honesty displayed by the administrator in addressing our issue was unacceptable.
