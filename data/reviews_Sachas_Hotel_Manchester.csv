Very questionable stay,"The reception staff made a huge deal about the identity which apparently all guests needed however stopped at this property before four times and this has never been the case.

The reception staff twice put the wrong dates including dates of the 31st of June and 1st July even though they is not 31 days in June and then changed it to 2nd and 3rd of July even though we would have checked out over 24 hours after this time, the staff were not over helpful and did not seem to understand some of the questions asked 

I was shocked when one member of staff told this couple that as she had ID and he had not as again this was not asked for when they stopped previously she was told she could stop but her husband could not, customer was not happy

Rooms like a furnace which is ok I winter but as no air con or the open air con that was working was blowing out hot air so that was not much good either and we paid over £300 for our parties was not good stay",Location was brilliant and the breakfast was ok nothing exceptional,5.0,July 2024,"July 2, 2024",Twin Room (No Windows),2,Family,5.8

Okay...,"Although the room was okay, I had a few weird experiences. When I first arrived, it was 11pm and the bouncer didn't want to let me into the building even though I had the booking reference (because I didn't have a room number), eventually he let me in and everything went smoothly through check in. Next, the room did not have any air conditioning, except for an old fan, which was a little difficult in a windowless room and when it was a very hot night (>20 degrees). The next morning the shower would only run extremely cold and when I tried again in the evening it only ran extremely hot, the temperature did not want to change at all.

Pleasant,"We chose a room without a window to save some money. We were ok with that, however, the air conditioning was not working properly hence the temperature was quite high.

Facilities such as the pool, jacuzzi, gym and downstairs restaurant bar were always closed and had no signs of being open any time soon. Odd smells walking along certain hallways and room corridors.

Happy,"Small hole in curtain and small marks on the wall but that really didn't bother me. I'm not one to go round nit picking. 
They needed to see my sons ID on check in which they didn't mention before so it was a good job he brought his ID. 
At night when we came home there was a party in one of the rooms and could smell weed. Couldn't hear it from our rooms though which was a good thing. The worst thing for us was that from both of our rooms there was a loud sound from outside sounded like a really loud air con so that kept us awake all night 🙄
Breakfast I was disappointed with as there wasn't much choice. Cereals were basic and there were no fried eggs","Rooms were nice, quick check in and they saved our luggage for us. 
Lovely ambiance in the reception, pub in the hotel although we didn't use it. Additional toilets in the hall, vending machine again which we didn't use but a good idea.

I had to pay an extra £20 for a room upgrade with a window as we could not stick the heat in the room. The second evening there was nobody attending the bar, there was 3 receptionists chatting across the way at reception, I approached them and asked if could they get me a glass of ice for the room from the bar, they would not, they said to wait until the bar person came back, so we sat and waited, 20 minutes later no sign of the bar person yet, I asked them would they walk behind the bar and get me a glass of ice, they still would not and was told to wait for the bar person. the bar person arrived 30 minutes later and provided us with a glass of ice for the room. The level of service was disgraceful, considering the receptionists were doing nothing but chatting with each other.

Second, they have a really strange system for taking your payment- they place a hold on your card for the first day of your stay and then want to ""complete"" the hold and charge you for the rest on a separate payment. This lead to them charging me in USD instead of GB pounds automatically, without my consent, which means that I ended up paying 7-10 dollars more for the one night for the room due to a bad exchange rate.

Yes it's an old design interior and i chose the cheapest room.
But the biggest conplaint i really have, is the mattress.
Im just an 183 cm, 86kg guy. I was literaly sleeping on the springs from the mattress. I never thought hotels would have those kind of mattress anymore, but this one had. I woke up with a very hard back/neck from the 3 nights that I was there. They could have gotten a better/updated mattress or just a thick mattress topper.


Next one is... there was no toiletbrush.... how in the world can i clean up after my hotspots....

Next.... The cheapest room we got had no windows which we were awere of, but it seemed like the room had no working ventilation. So it got very hot especially at night. Theres was just a fan in the room, that says it enough.

Last one... i got no information about any roomservice and how i could get more toiletpaper. I went to the receptionist to get more toiletpaper. 
A week earlier i was at a hotel in Sweden where they said at the reception when i booked in: if i would need room service, I'd have to contact the receptionist in advanced, to reduce cost and stuff like that. Which was nice.

"Excellent location, reasonable price, lovely staff. Not ideal for longer stays.","In relation to perceived problems with the room, I can appreciate that any ongoing renovations or maintenance might have been affected by previous lockdown and COVID regulations, or other external circumstances. 
However, these are some other minor details that might put off potential guests:

- My biggest concern was to do with the door between my room and the one next door, which did not have an appropriate cover/shield over the keyhole. Instead, it was stuffed with tissue paper. 
Although I didn't complain at the time, I found this a bit unsettling regarding guest privacy, safety, and comfort. 

- Secondly, I had access to complimentary tea/coffee with a kettle and cups, but no drinking water. Instead, I had to get this from the vending machine on the ground floor. 
This might not seem like a big deal, but for most hotel guests, every penny counts. This should have been a fair expectation after I had already spent a reasonable, though for me, not an insignificant amount of money. 

- Finally, although it isn't a cheap feature, it would have been made better if there had been a laundry service included. 
I don't usually stay in hotels for any longer than a night, but for two nights or longer - it's a necessity. 
Not ideal when you're in a part of the city that doesn't have easy access to a self-service laundrette.

The quality of the room alone ""met my expectations"", but only just.","Although in desperate need of an update, this is a great spot for a short stay, just around the corner from Piccadilly and a short walk from the train station. In the summer months, it's ideal for hitting spots around Oxford Street where you have access to some brilliant vintage shops, cafés, and pubs.

If you stay here don't touch anything or have a shower. You'll likely be cleaner this way.,"The interior rooms didn't have air con so was like sleeping in a sauna.

If you're nervous about leaving stuff in your room, don't worry. There's no chance anyone will pop in and steal it as there don't appear to be any cleaning staff. 

The beer in the bar tastes like it has been in the pipes for about 3 months before you get there. Oh and there's an awful hissing in there too which I'm assuming is to keep air moving in rooms without sunshine. It's the most irritating thing in the world.

You get what you pay for.,"Could have been cleaner, and one light wasn't working. Because the room has no window there's a ventilator going constantly which can be pretty loud. I'd recommend ear plugs. The fire alarm going off for 10 seconds at 5am wasn't ideal either, although I guess there wasn't a fire after all which is good? Also the bedsheets were really weird - the duvet cover covered the top of it but not the bottom, which means the bit touching your body is a) not cleaned and b) pretty scratchy.","It's a cheap room and you're not going to get 5 star service, but it's fine for somewhere to crash in Manchester city centre for one night.

(About Britannia Hotel) Old fancy-looking and cheap hotel in an excellent location.,"(This review is about its sister Britannia Hotel since I was moved there due to renovation works) I understood that the Wi-Fi in the room was free, but no. This service is not very expensive, though. The corridor carpets would benefit from a deep clean. The fire alarm sounding once every day at a random time is bothering. The hotel seems well-maintained but short-staffed, so in peak hours it can be hard to reach the staff. There is basically no room service. I left a bag with dirty clothes for the laundry service and after 2 days they didn't manage to do it and gave me back my dirty clothes (for free, obviously). The magnetic cards that open the doors seem to be a bit unreliable.

Honest,"The downsides:

Fragment of egg shell on one of the beds 
A curly hair on one of the beds 

The hotel room needs a good going over with a microfibre cloth and some polish. Thick dust in places such as inside the closet.

The room windows need some good TLC and give them a good wipe down and deep clean.

Other than that I can’t really complain for the price!

I hope these small recommendations are taken reasonably as mentioned above if in Manchester again for a concert/night out I will be a returning customer.

Thanks for the stay.","So it’s only fair to give this hotel a good honest review.

This hotel was booked for a concert taking place at the o2 Ritz. Myself and a mate booked the hotel based on location and lowest price.

We paid £69 for one night and was booked as a room with no windows.

Upon arrival my pal took a picture of the front of the hotel for his Instagram. Almost immediately a friend of his who lives in Manchester replied “NO” we then got the story of the hotels reviews and reputation…

Now after hearing from a trusted source that out hotel was branded one of the worst in Manchester we were quick to check Trip Advisor.

Trip Advisor brands this hotel 2/5 and “Poor”.

Reviews include: rooms that are broken into, prostitutes that steal your money who sit in the bar area & then the various specimens & goods within the room. Such as “poo on the bed sheets & a baguette and glasses underneath the bed”

Now for my review.

We checked in swiftly as soon as we entered the hotel lobby we were greeted and checked in within a matter of 2/3 minutes. We were asked if we would like a smoking or non smoking room. To which my friend replied “I didn’t know that they even existed. As non smokers we opted for a non smoking room.

Our room was based upon the second floor which was accessible by the lift.

Upon entry to our room we were pleasantly surprised to have been “upgraded” to a room with a window.

2 single beds. A cute petit TV. Table with kettle and a sandwich bag of tea/ coffee etc.

This hotel did not live up to the horrendous reviews we had read online. You have to question peoples opinions when as the saying goes “You get what you pay for”.

For 2 lads going to a concert and using the hotel as a base it was great. Cheap, central & convenient.

Before being overly put off by reviews give it a chance all that being dependant what you are staying for!

Pleasant,"There were a couple of things. We checked in and asked if we could have 2 glasses from the bar, the reception guy said just got to the bar. We went to the bar they sent us back to reception. Needless to say we went up without glasses. 
The main thing was I clicked pay at property, we were staying on the Friday night, the hotel took the money out the Tuesday before. I questioned this as it wasn't actually me paying on the day, they said it was because it was a busy weekend and they wanted to make sure room was paid for etc however you could still book a room at this hotel in the Friday. I checked. 
They then said it was in a holding and if I cancelled before Friday I would get it back. I just went along with it, put my card in the machine the Friday when we got there, it was approved of course but the money didn't then leave my bank till the Tuesday after. Now I have stayed in many hotels and paid several ways and never has this happened before. 
I do feel there was no reason for this other than the fact I had down graded my original room as we were going to arrive later.

Long story short a hotel with a restaurant had none!!! Like seriously it wouldn't have broken his heart to get a bit of salt.

No effort was made to check my report by visiting the floor or room and was instead advised to pay extra to switch to a different room which of course i did because why would i want to stay in a room/floor that stunk of cannabis.

The hotel looks very tired & dated and really badly needs a refurbishment but is part of the Brittania Group so that’s very unlikely, but it’s better than the Brittania & the staff were trying really hard to please and do a good job in the face of some rather questionable guests who seemed to have very little in the way of respect and thought it was ok to swear at reception staff because the 2 couples in his party weren’t in rooms on the same floor. It’s one of the cheapest hotels In Manchester and so does attract less affluent visitors or last minute / last option guests, but you get what you pay for and it’s a decent hotel and decent value, very central and deserves a better reputation than the one it has because it’s better than expected, I was surprised & it exceeded my expectations, which is unusual. so not my first Choice hotel In Manchester but not my last either.","The rooms were a lot better than I expected, I booked a double  room without a window for £75 but what I got was a triple room with lots of window, on two levels. so pleasantly surprised.",6.0,April 2023,"April 9, 2023",Double Room (No Windows),1,Group,5.8

Not really the 'bang for my bucks' that I was hoping for!,"The rooms are tired, not particularly decorative but the finish in the rooms is poor. You wouldn't accept a finish like that at your own home.

Only 1 window with a net curtain therefore could only open 1 set of curtains as we were overlooked by other buildings.

Shower was pathetic, the dribble of water that did come out was hot though but not in any great quantity, it was probably one of those water saving showers.

To be honest, other than the location of this hotel, there is no other reason for the price - which frankly I thought was extortionate. Just because other hotels in the area charge the same price doesn't warrant this hotel following suit. With a hand on my heart, I feel like this is a £60 a night room.

There's nothing particularly wrong with it but when you consider that for an extra £126 I could actually get 6 nights all inclusive in Greece (which I have done) it kind of puts things into perspective a little!

Last thing that really grated on me was the 10am check-out time. That's early, especially for a Sunday morning and it cut across breakfast too which was 8 - 10...like - what am I supposed to do - eat breakfast or check out?

Writting this review has certainly focused my thoughts on my 1 night stay at £124 and I'm not saying that this hotel is any better or worse than any others in the area but I do actually feel like I was taken advantage of. When I can't say that there was 1 thing that stood out that was nice or embraced me as a customer, I felt like I was more of a burden.

There was also a massive weed problem during our stay, the whole hotel stunk of cannabis, to the extent that I hope I don't get drugs tested anytime soon because there's no way I couldn't have ingested that through secondary smoke inhalation.","Location is fantastic, breakfast was included.

The door men were grand, they actually were the people who had more time and interaction with the guests than the actual hotel staff and nothing was too much trouble for them, they were really friendly, very polite and well mannered - they were the highlight of the stay really.",6.0,July 2022,"July 11, 2022",Double Room (No Windows),1,Couple,5.8

We had what we needed for a short stay.,"Very noisy. There was a door opposite our room which was for staff use only (we were in 352) and this door was banging closed late into the night. It woke me and my daughter on multiple occasions. Also there is an extremely noisy bar has opened down the street which made it difficult to sleep, I know this cant really be controlled by the hotel but it did affect our stay somewhat. I felt sorry for the people in the apartments facing the hotel who have to put up with this bar's racket every weekend. If you choose to stay at Sacha's, perhaps ask for a room far away from the bar next to Affleks, if you want a decent night's sleep. One evening a man was running around on our landing, whooping and shouting, I think he may have been drunk. Nevertheless, poor guest behaviour is not really the hotels fault. Apart from these annoyances the hotel was fine. Grotty lift though.","The room was basic but it was clean and had what we needed in it. The man on reception was very friendly and helpful.

Fine but could have been better.,"The hotel was very outdated, parts of the carpet in the hallway had been taped over where they ripped instead of being replaced. The shower was odd, hard to turn the knob on and off, and the shower head sprayed water everywhere. There weren't enough lifts which caused accessibility problems, we had to wait longer than should be necessary for a lift down to breakfast. A wheelchair user was trying to get down to breakfast as well and had to get out of the chair and shuffle down the steps to where breakfast was being served.","The room was standard, what you'd expect for a hotel room. The bed was fine. It was in the centre of Manchester and within walking distance of most tourist attractions, the free bus stops just down the road.
