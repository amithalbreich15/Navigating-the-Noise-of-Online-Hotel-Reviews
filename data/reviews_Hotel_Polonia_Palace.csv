On that note, please get trolleys so nobody has to come in the room. They can just wheel the food in and go. Will be much easier to clean up too.

Very Good,"I stayed at room 439 from 01. july to 03.july
Polonia Palace is a very nice hotel with helpful staff, there is nothing to complain about.
However I want to give feedback on taxi booking, I think some hotel staff work with illegal taxi cabs. I asked the staff to book a taxi for me around kl.16.30 sunday 03.july, a man (who also has responsibility for luggage) asked me if I would pay with cash or card. I said I would pay with cash. A shabby taxi came, it took 90 Zloty for a tour from the hotel to Chopin airport, I asked the taxi driver why it was  expensive, it took just 33 Zloty for me from the airport to the hotel. I asked for a receipt, and he gave me some paper. In the haste, I didn't check the receipt carefully, i had to take the luggage out of the car by myself, he didn't help me with that. When I checked it again, the paper he gave me was not a receipt at all, just a piece of paper.

Stay at Polonia Palace,"We ordered the Limo service from Modlin Airport and we were quoted €85. The driver was there ready for us, the car was neat and clean. When we pulled up to the hotel the driver asked us for cash. Not only that but €95, not the originally quoted €85. He told us that he perfers cash. Now I wouldn't complain about €10, but after a flight and arriving to the hotel at midnight,  it was offputting that we had to dig for euro. We did not complain, just paid the money. We ended up canceling the Limo service going back to the Airport because of this. Poland has Uber, the cost of an Uber to the Airport is only €25 thats Including tip.","The Palace was absolutely beautiful,  clean and great service. The breakfast buffet is a MUST!

One week business stay,"The check-out experience was uncomfortable, as the hotel failed to charge for the entire stay beforehand and asked to provide a credit card once more. This was extremely unpleasant with a taxi waiting outside for pick-up (4 persons). Basically, we asked for an invoice and everything one day before, but for some reason their staff failed to do the procedure and we had a major delay because of that. 
The breakfast porridge was packed with sugar.  Please stop adding sugar in the food beforehand, I can add some if I want directly to my bowl.  There was no hot milk during the breakfast and I had to ask for it every morning.
The gym wasn't open 24/7, so you have to go into reception and ask for them to open it early in the morning. The gym could use a yoga mat and a yoga ball as well, but that is just my preference. 
Due to the inconvenient check-out experience I would expect the hotel to remedy the situation by providing a discount or similar, but nothing was done, apart from a ""sorry"".","Room was clean, nice and spacious.

Beautiful hotel with a room to improve.,"As much as I can appreciate the fact that the staff were doing their best to be professional there is certainly a gap in their experience to match the quality of the hotel it wants to be. Especially the Lobby Bar staff when you could see staff chatting rather than make sure the tables were attended to. 
In some cases food took forever to arrive. The offer for breakfast for two people was attractive (95zl) but for one was unjustifiable (90zl) which meant I went to look for alternatives outside (found a lovely caffe “Warsaw caffe” pretty much next door to the hotel) with more appropriate pricing. 
The cleaning staff were lovely and extremely helpful. 
I never got a chance to use the SPA and it’s a pity that the brochure for the facility was not left in the room. The only ways to find out about the SPA offer was to ring either the SPA or the reception - would have been handier to have it left in the room so the guests could have more time to decide on what and when they would like to get done.","The hotel is situated perfectly in the heart of the city.

Tried to contact reception (sent them emails and called them several times) and asked if they could return me the jacket (I was supposed to be in Warsaw in a week or so, so it would be easy for me to pick it up).

It could have been much better for this money.,"The check-in process is absolutely terrible! I arrived at 15.00 and waited for 45 minutes for check in in a huge queue. The experience was very bad. The people at the check in were very slow!!! and only 2 out of 3 (or 4) of the check-in desks were opened in the hotel 'rush hour'. Many rooms were not ready at 15.00 (!) and people had to wait in the lobby for their rooms to be cleaned. The room was fine but it was way to expensive for the comfort (425 PLN / 95 EUR) and it had zero view (view on some strange, dark patio). I will not stay at that hotel again.","I liked the central location, in the very heart of Warsaw, close to the train station, Palace of Culture and the main attractions.

"rude staff, no food at night","I arrived at 22.45h hoping to be able to eat something, as I couldn’t have dinner before. however, there was a long queue to check in and by the time I arrived to the counter it was 23.02h. I asked if I could quickly order room service or grab something from the bar before going to my room (the bar was full of people) and the guy at the reception said “no, check in first”. i tried to explain him that I needed to eat and he was like “well, later you can try at the bar, but it will be closed and there’s no room service anymore”. I couldn’t believe jt. not only he was not helping — he was obstructing me from getting food. when I finished the check in, I run into the bar and the staff there was also rude and unhelpful, telling me they couldn’t make anything at this time (mind you, room service apparently finishes at 23.00h) and almost laughing that I wouldn’t get to eat that night. to avoid starving, I had to walk to McDonalds in the train station 7 mins. away — alone, almost at midnight. my most unpleasant experience so far with a hotel in Poland. surely I won’t return, and I’m still waiting for them to apologise about the staff's behaviour.","nice room, location",4.0,June 2022,"June 12, 2022",Standard Double,1,Solo traveler,9.2

We were a family travelling with kids and we had 2 rooms booked, requesting connecting rooms or at least close to each other. Instead we were given rooms at the opposite ends of the hotel. Eventually after pleading and requesting for a long long time, the room was changed but it made our evening miserable.

Not the best choice if you want to feel safe.,"I have traveled around Europe during Covid and I wasn't prepared for the fact that Poland allows being around without wearing masks. I am vaccinated but nonetheless, it's important to be safe and wear a mask and no one of the guests except us and a few people wore a mask inside the hotel. I was really disturbed by the staff not wearing correctly the mask (always under the nose) and most of all, from all people at breakfast time going in mass to the buffet without wearing masks, no hand disinfection when entering, no distance... and when I told it to the staff, they answered that they couldn't do anything about that, and that after all, all guests are vaccinated. Moreover, it happened in all 3 days, that the staff removed our plates from the table while we were eating in them. I expected more professionality from a 4-stars-hotel. 
As for the cleaning of the room, they were really clean and comfy, but we remained without soap in the shower and for the hands on the last days. Pretty important during covid...","I loved the building and its historical atmosphere. The position is great and the rooms are very quiet. The breakfast has a variety of food, delicious.

"Bad experience, hotel doesn't care about guest comfort","Probably my worst experience ever in a hotel. 
A few things first. What's the point of a fitness center when you have TWO machines only and a few weights lying around? The place is smaller than a bedroom. Most of the facilities in the hotel are as ""check marks"" to get a rating but not really good enough to compare this place to the other good hotels. This feels like a bit outdated hotel tbh.

Getting to the main point - We had to check out at 6am to take our train to the next destination but the previous night , the hotel has a party that is going on till 2AM with loud music that does not allow you to sleep at all !! When I complained at 11:30 pm at night, the receptionist said that they don't have quiet hours or any policy for noise and basically said they can't do anything. I suggested that they at least could lower the noise. The receptionist said they would do so but after 15 mins the noise in fact increased. 

The receptionist offered to change the room to one that is away from the noise but there was no point of repacking for a few hours before checkout. Why did the hotel not give us the quieter room when we checked in a day before ? The hotel knew of the party and still decided to give us a room closer to the noise. 

Really ridiculous and mostly unhelpful reception and the hotel that doesn't really care about guests. I have no idea how this place has such good reviews.",The downstairs area and breakfast area are decent. We didn't pick the breakfast option but it did look nice.
