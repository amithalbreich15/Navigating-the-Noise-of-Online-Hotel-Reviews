"Really cool, quirky hotel.",Everything was great.,"Awesome quirky hotel! Great social lobby with unique decor. Great breakfast buffet and bar, really comfortable bed. The room, although cozy, was laid out very well. Sensible placement of plugs, lights etc. I keep looking in every nook and cranny to see what other cool things were hidden away. We really enjoyed our stay. I will be seeking out CitizenM hotels around the world from now on.",10,July 2023,"July 31, 2023",King Room,1,Family,9

A very pocket friendly and excellent accommodation near Bukit Bintang,Nothing to dislike here.,"Located southwest of Bukit Bintang's central area, this property is 10 minutes from popular spots like Jalan Alor Food Street, Art Street, Times Square, etc. There is a convenience store and a supermarket with an ATM next to the hotel building, and grabbing a taxi with the Grab app is never an issue.
The bed was super comfortable and the pop interiors of this hotel are impressive. The hotel is super clean and the breakfast spread was just right. We arrived at 0200AM in the morning and did not have any problems thanks to the 24-hour reception.
The checkout is also very fast and smooth.

You cannot enter the hotel without your room key card after 2400, which is a good security measure.",9.0,August 2024,"August 14, 2024",King Room,3,Couple,9

Best sleep.,Would be nice to have normal colour lights. The different lights was hard to live with.

Exceptional,,"I loved everything about this hotel! You can control everything using a small Ipad, from the windows, the LED and television! If you are a Digital Nomad/Remote Worker, you will absolutely fall in love with this place! The internet connection is excellent and there is a shared space where you can meet other remote workers. For a hotel this affordable, it ultimately exceeded my expectations. I would give this hotel a rating of 11 if the website lets me to!",10,May 2024,"August 12, 2024",King Room,3,Solo traveler,9
Comfortable stay in a good location,"I wish that the light control was a little bit more fine-grained (i.e. can turn off only specific lamps through the app).

Nice hotel,,"We know this hotel from other cities. This time we were three with a 5-year-old son. We had concerns whether sleeping in a bed with three would be comfortable enough. It turned out that our stay was great. We slept comfortably. The room was well-equipped and big enough. Great location, close to most attractions and public transport. The hotel staff were very helpful. We will gladly come back!",10,July 2024,"August 2, 2024",King Room,4,Family,9
Great location and pretty hotel,"The AC temperature can only go up to 28 max. It was really cold in our room and we couldnt do anything about it. 

Not a big issue but might be helpful for others: When you check in, you will have the option to choose a room with ""city"" or ""green"" view. We chose the green view thinking it would be a park or garden view, but turned out our room was looking at only a wall, with some small plants by the window. I think it would be better to have some real photos of the rooms at that step, which will be helpful for first time KL visitors :)","Great location, very good shower, friendly vibe, super fast check in and check out.

Exceptional,"I stayed for a few nights at citizenM Bukit Bintang on separate occasions. A little feedback on my second stay: the toilet and floor were a bit unclean and the air conditioner is not working and it was inconvenient that there was no kettle in the room, so I had to get hot water from the lobby restaurant whenever I needed it.

"Great location, but needs to work out some kinks.","The iPad for controlling the room seemed cool, at first. But after awhile, it was a pain to change channels on the tv and other functions as the iPad was always in sleep mode. So you had to wake it up, go to the media setting, then change your channel.

"My stay was marked by exceptional service, a vibrant and unique hotel atmosphere, will book again!","To be honest, the only minor issue during my stay was the noise from some lively kids next door, which wasn't the fault of the hotel. However, a quick phone call to the reception resolved the issue promptly. Apart from this small inconvenience, there was absolutely nothing to fault about the hotel. Everything else about my experience was delightful!","I recently had the pleasure of staying at a wonderfully located hotel in Malaysia, and it absolutely exceeded all my expectations! As a first-time visitor, its central location made it incredibly convenient to explore the must-see attractions around. Upon arrival, the self-service check-in process was a breeze, enhanced by the warm welcome from the friendly staff. The manager, Duncan, personally greeted me and even offered a refreshing welcome drink, which was a lovely touch.
The hotel itself boasted a cool, unique design that added an element of fun to my stay. Originally placed in a courtyard-facing room, I requested a switch to a city view, and they accommodated my preference immediately and without any additional charge. I was impressed by the cleanliness, safety, and overall friendly atmosphere of the hotel and their cool all-in-one touch system that sets the mood, TV, lighting, and temperature!
What truly set this hotel apart was the exceptional service, especially from a staff member named Eriq. Eriq was not only professional and knowledgeable but also genuinely caring. He went above and beyond by assisting me with a personal issue I encountered, which speaks volumes about his dedication to guest comfort.
I am already looking forward to my next stay at this hotel. For anyone seeking a clean, safe, and friendly place to stay in Malaysia, this hotel is a fantastic choice. Highly recommended!",10,June 2024,"June 14, 2024",King Room,2,Solo traveler,9

Loo and shower behind frosted glass and sink in main room. I found this set up a little disconcerting until I realised that there is a curtain separating the bathroom element of the room for privacy.

Modern Comfort and Stylish Design: A Review of My Stay at CitizenM Hotel,the washbasin felt a bit cramped and could have been larger for added comfort and functionality.,"During our recent family trip to Kuala Lumpur, we had the pleasure of staying at CITIZENM, a truly unique and technology-equipped hotel. From the moment we stepped into the lobby, we were captivated by the impeccable decor, featuring pieces by renowned artists that added a touch of sophistication to the space. The atmosphere exuded a youthful and vibrant vibe, reminiscent of a Silicon Valley startup, which we found both refreshing and exciting.

What truly set CITIZENM apart, however, was the exceptional staff. The level of hospitality we experienced was beyond compare. Duncan, the boss, was incredibly welcoming and made us feel like valued guests. Lily and Jeswyn stood out as beacons of warmth and assistance throughout our stay, going above and beyond to ensure our needs were met and that we had an unforgettable experience.

The technology-infused rooms added an innovative twist to our stay. The seamless control of various room features through the tablet provided a modern and convenient touch. It felt like we were experiencing the future of hospitality firsthand.

The breakfast at CITIZENM was a delightful surprise. Despite not being a large buffet, the variety and taste of the dishes were impressive. The handcrafted coffee and chocolate were standout highlights, adding a delicious touch to our mornings. Overall, the breakfast experience added to the exceptional stay we had at the hotel.

In conclusion, our time at CITIZENM was a delightful blend of cutting-edge technology, artistic ambiance, and exceptional service.

"Great location, comfortable room, modern youthful design. Convenient breakfast.","Although the breakfast is very convenient, we do not feel like the standard matches the price. It's a shame since the coffee and tea served is great and the chef's abilities are evidently not lacking. A slightly bigger selection of foods, fruits, or a larger focus on a continental breakfast rather than a split between continental and asian dishes on an already small selection would make the breakfast better in our opinion.

For future guests, I can't recommend many local breakfast options as the restaurants generally open mid-day and the closest caf√©s that serve a breakfast are found in the malls, which aren't close enough for a convenient breakfast trip.

One extremely nit-picky thing we noticed is that the hinges on the glass bathroom doors were starting to fail, which made closing the bathroom doors fully impossible. As the room itself is small, it makes for a slightly uncomfortable ""number 2"" when someone else is in the room.","The location of CitizenM Kuala Lumpur is great and is probably the main reason for its price point. Great access to Bukit Bintang. Even locations such as the Petronas Towers are within walking distance on a fully pedestrian accessible route if you're up for the few kilometre journey.

Comfort was beyond expectation. Although the room is small, the bed and other amenities were of high standard. The iPad system to control the lights and connect other devices to the TV were simple to use. The fact that we could connect our own Netflix and YouTube accounts to the TV securely made our nights much more enjoyable. Double layered curtains made a sleep-in very possible, or gave us confidence in privacy from the neighbouring buildings and main road.

The location felt safe. We walked back from the centre of Bukit Bintang on many late nights and did not notice anything strange or of concern. The front area of the hotel is generally quiet at night, yet there is security in the lobby and the main entrance requires a keycard during late hours.

The staff were very helpful and did much more than expected, including ordering Grab Taxis for us and recommending local tourist attractions.",8.0,November 2022,"January 5, 2023",King Room,3,Couple,9

I'd had very little sleep and felt exhausted. The staff were lovely and kind and welcoming so no criticism of them but had there been a choice, I would have preferred to have staff in this instance do the check-in for me as it would have allowed me to take a breath and relax a little on arrival.

Very Good,"The breakfast setup appears to have been copied straight from a European chain hotel (which they probably are anyway; didn't check). It has very limited choices (in Amsterdam or D√ºsseldorf this might be acceptable, but is seriously below what I would expect anywhere in Asia). Like at 10-20% of what it should be. Very few choices, a weird and annoying manual toaster. Strongly suggest to throw out this whole concept, and get an experienced Asian consultant in to fix this. Until this is improved, I'd suggest not spending any money on breakfast here. 
Otherwise no complaints.","This hotel brand appears to be of European origin. The public areas are done in a kind of homely, creative design. The rooms are fully automated, everything is controlled from an iPad in the room, which is kind of cool but also presents a minor learning curve (it takes a minute or so to figure out how things work). Bed is big and comfortable, shower good. The few staff I interacted with were very friendly and helpful.

"Definitely will stay again, great bargain for citizen m hotels.","Shout out to Shanya and female tattooed malay supervisor in the mornings.  Great example of hands off, mature friendliness.  However, many of the other staff members a bit too 'full-on' they kind of hover around you as they don't have a set place to stay unlike in other hotels and it seems they are overtrained to greet the guests at every moment so you end up having to return greetings about 10 times per day which gets exhausting when all you want to do is work/study in the common area.  One staff member in particular, young lady, sprinted after me as I got into the elevator, jammed herself in the closing the door just to ask if I wanted to pay for my coffee 'now or put it on your bill'.  Just a bit too 'on you.'  So yeah, their training is making many of the staff become, well, a bit creepy is the only word for it.  Nice bunch and not their fault (probably) - but they gotta chill out and calm down when they have guests lol.
Sheets and pillows seem a bit cheap and not so good, mattress good.  Everything else great.",Extended stay to 5-6 nights.

Sound isolation was excellent. Could not hear a thing from outside the room. One night there was a very heavy downpour, yet I couldn't hear the rain while in the room.

The room is a little small. I had no issues with room size as a solo traveler, but it may be a bit cramped for two. Bathroom was quite small as well, requiring a bit of maneuvering to get around the swinging shower door.

The view from the room wasn't great. It was facing an opposing block. It wasn't a problem for me, I just kept the blinds closed.

Almost Perfect (except for early check in),We came from an overseas flight and needed an early check in. Hotel charged us almost an additional day price (159 MYR early check in - 167.15 MYR room rate) and it doesn‚Äôt include a breakfast. We were exhausted and needed to accept it but it is not a fair price at all.,"Very helpful staff (Mary and all the team was fantastic, I can‚Äôt highlight this enough), great decoration, cleanliness, good location, cozy rooms and perfect breakfast..

"Great location, close to the metro & plenty of food options nearby.","The two thirds scale room was disappointing as was the crawl into bed. At the breakfast more cut fruit would be great. One thing that should definitely be improved upon is the placing of tea & coffee making facilities in the room , currently not available. This is not acceptable in an alleged four star establishment.","If you want to bring out your inner neck tattooed hipster, then this is the hotel for you. Duncan and his staff are very friendly and helpful. The coffee was barista made and the breakfast buffet was tasty and filling. The location is good being a short walk from the metro, food & night life. Lighting, television etc. is all controlled by an iPad. The more senior guest should probably travel with a least one grandchild to assist with the navigation of this device.",6.0,June 2024,"June 20, 2024",King Room,4,Couple,9
Okay if you spend most of your time exploring the city.,"The view from the room was quite bad and it was hard to tell if the blackout curtain was down or not at night..
Limited breakfast buffet and the coffee taste was not good. (you can get better coffee across the street). For the in-room controls, it is all done through the iPad which was annoying to use as it was quite slow and laggy, would have preferred a switch for the AC/Lights. The hotel charged me more than the price listed on booking.com without informing me. The all-day dining menu was below average, we ordered a pepperoni pizza one night and received a warmed-up ready-made pizza that came from a box at a hotel rate and took over 30 minutes.","Great location with everything being within walking distance and a bus stop in front.

Average,"1. Unfortunately there was an issue with the aircond, apparently in our floor. Staff was nice to change the room but the new room still had the same issue. But it was quickly rectified by a staff. Suggest to do consistent checks on the facilities as it can be troublesome for some visitors who may be tired from their trip and due to the hot weather.
2. Secured my room at a slight lower price on this app but eventually payment is made at the property. Quite misleading. My supposed price on booking is 294 but was charged 311 per night upon checking in.","Near to hotspots in KL City Centre, and room‚Äôs cleanliness.",5.0,June 2023,"June 3, 2023",King Room,1,Couple,9

They lied to me about avalable rooms and the pictures they have in their account of KL is not taken from the hotel itsel,"A brief review: They lied to me about avalable rooms and the pictures they have in their account of KL is not taken from the hotel itself, the best you‚Äôll see from the hotel is just the street front door or the slums-like neighborhood on the back.

A detailed review:
- When I was checking-in, I asked the staff to put me in a room with a city view, they told me ‚Äúsorry they‚Äôre all fully booked, a spoiler alert, that was a lie‚Äù, then I said okay no worries, when I got to the room, I saw what could be the worst view I‚Äôve ever seen from a hotel‚Äôs window. I got down to the lobby, and I told him I was here for the city view as it was my last day in KL, then he told me okay I‚Äôll move you ‚Äúagain, he told me everything was fully booked just a few minutes before, then all of a sudden, there were many empty rooms‚Äù.

- I booked this hotel because of one of the pictures I saw on booking.com, just to learn that the hotel was putting these pictures as an advertisement, but they‚Äôve nothing to do with the view you can get from the rooms, or anywhere in the hotel, I‚Äôm talking about views of KL.

- They don‚Äôt have a rooftop or anywhere in the hotel where you can see a nice view of the city, the best you‚Äôll see from the hotel is just the street front door or the slums-like neighborhood on the back.",How huge the lobby is.,6.0,May 2024,"June 15, 2024",King Room,1,Solo traveler,9
