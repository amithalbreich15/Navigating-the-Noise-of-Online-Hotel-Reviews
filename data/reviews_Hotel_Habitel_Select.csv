"Good location for layovers, breakfast. Make sure you check cleaningness as soon as you enter.","I rented two rooms, for the 2 there was a window in each room imposible to close, so all the cold breeze and plane noises entered during the night.
Also for one of the rooms, the bathroom was stinking of cigarette smoke. Since we arrived to late we didn't request to be moved to another room. But it kinda makes you wonder if the bathroom was cleaned in the first place.","It is very close to the airport, has a shuttle service every half hour.
Good breakfast options.

Really awesome!,"They were doing some bigger construction work. While I didn't hear too much noise, the part of the hotel that our room was in looked very unfinished from outside.

Dissapointed,"When i was doing the check-in there was not order with the guests at the front desk all over, not line even though i was patiently waiting only 2 people working , the facilities at the hotel were not mentioned just kind of "" here is your key, bye bye"" and that's it. Not explaining where where elevator were, nothing mentioned about the breakfast in the morning even though it was included with my room, not mentioned of the Wi-Fi, the check-in  process  was very poor. I didn't find the staff very friendly during check in. First impression! It's nice when staff acknowledge and notice you are there and this was not the case.

1st night couldn't sleep so much noise in the hallway coming from other guests 11-2am. I had to change rooms to another floor next day.

I have a few family members coming to see me that I haven't seen in 25 years, they came in the evening and the staff at the front desk said to them and to me that it was not visiting hours, and they can charge me extra. I felt embarrassed and sad like I mentioned haven't seem them in 25 years it supposed to be exciting to see my family, they couldn't come earlier because there were driving from another city, they were coming for a short visit not to stay with me in my hotel room.
I disagree with this rule its ridiculous. I worked for the hospitality industry and stayed in many hotels and never heard this rule.","Staff was great at the restaurant, great food, great location, comfortable bed.",7.0,May 2024,"May 25, 2024",Executive Twin Room,3,Couple,8.2

"Great location, but painfully s-l-o-w desk staff","Check-in was painful. When we arrived in the morning, we provided all the needed check-in information. Later, when we returned to the hotel to get a room assignment, we had to repeat the same process all over again – but this time it took 25 minutes, reminding us of the sloth scene in Zootopia. Check out was also painfully slow.  And the room could have used a more thorough cleaning, although it was acceptable.","The Habitel airport hotel was convenient. It’s located just outside the airport, and just a few minutes’ walk to the Transmilenio and bus “CIAC” stop.  There was great coffee in the lobby.

In general it's a very good hotel for travelers using the Bogotá airport.,"The bagged breakfast they gave us to take was terrible. I imagine if we had been able to eat breakfast there it would have been better. The jacuzzi was filled with yellow water which was a disappointment.
On the weekends they do not have anyone in their spa to give massages. I was injured at the airport and was sad not to get the massage I needed or a clean hot water jacuzzi.",The closeness to the airport was terrific as I had a very early flight.

Convinient and comfortable hotel for stay near airport,"Ok so we stayed at this hotel 3 times and all 3 times the wait to check in/speak to reception staff was very long so maybe they need more staff on reception. The hotel is pretty popular with airline staff so gets busy. The last time we checked in they temporarily lost our booking so we were kept waiting a long time after a long flight. 

The second time we stayed, the toilet had been used/not cleaned and was super gross haha. But I think this was an oversight, as the rest of the time it was great. 

Lastly one time we were getting a taxi pick up from the hotel and the taxi wasn't permitted in so we had to walk with quite a lot of bags to the main entrance and then they wouldn't let us out without clearance from security and the taxi almost left by that point - I guess it's good to know that they take security seriously though!","This hotel is super convinient if you have an overnight stopover between flights and we stayed several times and there's an easy and frequent pick up from the airport in an organised bus. 

They also let you store bags, which was useful as we had to leave a few things behind for a week due to a trip in a light aircraft. 

The breakfast was very good (their empanadas were so incredible we talked about them for a week!) although better if you go early in the morning. 

The room (triple room) was a really decent size with comfortable beds and nice bathroom. I thought it was good value for money.",8.0,July 2022,"August 22, 2022",Standard Triple Room,1,Group,8.2

its an ok place to stay for a few days,breakfast was pretty simple stuff.  The check out cost of 10000 cop which we were not expecting!  no pool no hot tub to relax for a bit,"breakfast was simple nothing great, good fruits and wieners.  Could have had more - pancakes, omelets etc...  very close to the airport and the shuttle is on the 2nd floor by gate 5 have your confirmation ready as they ask for it.  Check in went ok, but it takes a bit of time.  Check out, they charged us an extra 10000 cop which was bizarre.  Then they charged us at check in which was 10usd more than the advertised price we booked through booking.com which was odd.  Trying to complain in columbia is impossible and everyone wants their cut (there is the local price then there is the tourist price, seen that many times).  Anyhow, the hotel was alright for an overnight stay.  No pool no hot tub, but the shower did have wonderful warm water, which is hard to find in columbia.  And, we brushed our teeth with the water and didn't get sick which is hard to do in columbia. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable enough. We didn't stay long though, just a 6hr visit as we had a flight in at midnight then flying out at 9am, I'll try to avoid that next time to spend a few days in bogata.

When people with reservations realize that they have preference (by having to approach the staff themselves to ask) and then skip the line that they were waiting in for a long time, people in the line are understandably pissed.

"I won’t recommend to stay, nor stay myself anymore in this hotel for more than one night.","During my last stays the room service staff has been inefficient and even rude. The cleaning service has been quite delayed and even if the manager did apologise for the inconveniences, I didn’t receive any sort of compensation (which I asked) for such inconveniences.
In conclusion, I have noticed during my last stays that the hotel services have worsen and the prices have increased, which is not at all a good sign.","The breakfast was really good but the fact that the waiters are desperately cleaning up your table, even before you have finished eating, makes the breakfast time a bit unpleasant.
The restaurants are very good, good food and good wine. Excellent customer service. But in general, the prices at the hotel are quite high for the quality. The hotel has been a perfect option to stay one night after a long trip, specially arriving late in the evening, since the airport transfer service is handy and fast and the breakfast is really good.

I won't be staying at Hotel Habitel Select again.,"The original room was no good.
Card did not work for access.
No fridge.
No wifi in the building except very near reception, so I had to move my laptop to the building next door.
This hotel is in fact two buildings.
Habitel1 and Habitel 2.
The latter has been recently refurbished ,so is more pleasant and the breakfast served in Habitel 2 is excellent as is the catering staff.
Cleaning staff in Habitel 1 were helpful as well.
The same cannot be said for the reservation or reception staff.
They work in either building.
Two of the receptionists were just not interested .
I was fortunate to secure a better room in Habitel 1.
When I explained to one of them that I wanted to change my romm, he became uncooperative and preferred to deal with a huge influx of other guests.
I waited for about and hour to see if I could get this new room and had to force my way into the queue.
He was clearly upset , but eventually I secured the room that worked .
Meanwhile the young woman who assigned me the original , defective room was bossing me around about where to have breakfast and wasn't in a good mood. But some other staff seemed better trained and much more polite. I have stayed in three hotels near El Dorado Airport in this price category and this has clearly been my worst experience.","I had to change my original room.

It offers a slightly cheaper price, but I finished my stay wishing I had spent the extra 10-20 dollars more per night for hotels located close by that are way better than this one. Breakfast is mediocre and does not stand out amongst other hotels similarly or even cheaper priced. It took 35 minutes to get checked in and the line was only 4 people. I drink the water in all parts of Colombia but this water is visibly brownish and they instruct you to get your drinking water at the dispensers by the elevator. lol.

We were incredibly tired having travelled some 30 hours from Australia and we arrived to the hotel at 11pm to find only one person working on the front desk and a checkin line took 1 hour and 30 mins until we got our key. 

On top of that, they couldn't care less about making us wait. No apologies, no compliementary water, or room discount was offered.

The hotel knows how many people are coming (they have pre-bookings) so to be short of staff at this time is just either incredibly poor management, or just total disregard for their customers.

Given our next flight was 6am, we basically had a shower and lay our heads on the pillow for 2 hours and then were off again. Basically an expensive shower and lie down.

We then checked in at reception and there was no record of our booking. We waited well over an hour when eventually they admitted the had given our rooms away to guests who had chosen to stay an extra night. We were then taken to the adjacent hotel, to be presented with two twin rooms with no space for an additional bed. We were a party of five. A totally ridiculous situation ensued whereby there appeared to be an ineffective discussion between front desk staff, and back office management. Still no resolution. Eventually on insisting on speaking to a manager, did someone appear and he reluctantly requested that the front desk staff find us an additional bed space. No apologies made and we began to wonder if there was some sort of scam going on. We got to bed after 2am, to get up three hours later for an early flight.

"If you want to stay close to the airport go elsewhere, this is one of the worst hotels I’ve stayed at","We were by reception, where two receptionists weren’t doing anything, not paying us any attention as we wanted to check in. Other people then pushed infront and got answered immediately. We then got to our room and some of the lights did not work. On check out you’d think that an airport would have a speedy check out, this was not the case we had to wait 20 minutes to leave the hotel and then dash to the airport. This genuinely was the worst place I stayed in Colombia, and I stayed in places that are rated far worse.

We waited in the lobby by the door and when I looked out again she told me we had missed it and that it had gone to the other Habitel location. We had to run to the other property and about to the driver to wait for us. After we boarded, the airport shuttle proceeded BACK to the first location (where we could have waited all along)!
