Great place to stay in terms of location and price and overall comfort.,The only thing that was subpar was the breakfast included.  Very little choice and mostly sweet pastries.  We would have willingly paid an extra 1000 ARS each (US 2.50) to get good quality dark bread and whole wheat croissants instead of the white bread offered.  But maybe the choice was appealing to the youngish crowd.  The breakfast is the sole reason we didn' give the place a 10/10!,"Excellent value for money!  Delightful people at reception.  Comfortable room. Toilet had a wide bowl so there was no need to flush twice or thrice to ""clean"" the sides...  Centrally located.  The greatest surprise was that the internet was the fastest we've seen (10MPS download; 8MPS upload) in 18 days in Argentina, which included a 5-day stay at a brand-named US hotel in Buenos Aires, and then local, smaller places in Ushaia, El Calafate, and El Chalten where 0.7MPS-1.5MPS was typical!

Great home base for your time in El Calafate!,I had a lower bunk which had a power outlet but the upper bunks didn't have an outlet so people sleeping there would charge their phones at night by the lockers instead which made for early mornings with loud alarms from their phones across the room. The beds were decent but not the most comfortable I'd had while traveling in Argentina.,The staff were excellent and super friendly and helpful. Breakfast included yogurt which was nice (more than just bread options) and they were good about refilling everything when it ran out. The internet was like many other places in town - it worked well when people were out on tours in the daytime but super slow in the mornings and evenings. The room (and bathroom) in my 4 bed dorm was cleaned daily which was really nice and they even made my bed.

Lacks the homey feel of a really good hostel.,"Staying at this hostel was a bag of mixed feelings for me. Everything is in place for it to be a great hostel, but somehow it made me feel like I was a  product being processed or a part traveling through a conveyor belt in a factory. It felt to me as though no one at the hostel ever took the time to think about the user experience of a guest. 

Let me give some examples; 
For reasons unknown to me, you can’t lock toilets. 
You share one key for a dorm room that sleeps six. 
The bunk beds are super high up. And don’t have supports to prevent you from falling out. I’m not squeamish but it actually felt uncomfortable to sleep in the top bunk. 
Speaking of the top bunk - there was nowhere to put any of your things. Not even a phone. I ended up sleeping with mine under the pillow. 
Climbing up and down was difficult. 
Chargers weren’t international - which is a small thing, but it’s the first hostel in Argentina that I’ve tried where i couldn’t charge my phone. 
None of the furniture was comfy. It somehow wasn’t nice to sit anywhere. 
And breakfast was like being in a busy high school canteen. They managed to run out of glasses too. And I’m assuming they provide the same service every day, so that shouldn’t be too difficult to fix. 

I hope the hostel owners try checking in and spending a few nights some day.

In my room the lower beds were great but on the upper beds you could not sit up",the „living room“ is great and has the best wifi connection. I work on the computer and could do that there very well. The breakfast is good and I liked that you can get it quite early (before day trips) but also quite late (until 10 am). The staff is great. Its warm inside and also the showers are good and warm.,8.0,October 2022,"October 20, 2022",Single Bed in 4-Bed Dormitory Room with Internal Bathroom,4,Solo traveler,8.5

The hostel was adequate for our needs.,"No A/C and literally no air flow even with the window wide open.

Handing in your key when you go out literally makes no sense at all, especially since they gave one of my family members the wrong key. I suspect they would give you any key # you asked for (so much for security).

I don’t believe they cater to families as I had to book 2 separate rooms - one for my wife & I & one for my son.

You literally have to put aside a good 3 hrs waiting for a washing machine or dryer to free up.",It was close to the busiest and most popular streets.,6.0,December 2023,"December 27, 2023",Double Room with Private Bathroom,2,Family,8.5

"What an attitude of the staff, so indifferent dont care kind","Staff service improvement is highly required. 

When I made another reservation after staying 2 days, there was neither claer explanation of room conditions, nor proper action to take for guest's request for help. 

On my second stay, When I asked to check the heating system whether it was working properly(turned on or now) due to so freezing room floor, the staff named Liam just pretended to check the heater but no action taken for 6 hours until refund was claimed for such unexpected/inconvenient room condition after 3 times of reminders. I had to wait such cold and it was 3 degree celcius outside. 

When I finally felt very unwelcomed by such attitude, he sent a guy to check the heater status after such refund request. The maintenance guy came to my room and told that it was turned off for hours... 

Staff Liam, he had Inexplicably indifferent attitude which gave me such unfavorable experience of this staying which worries other guest services. 

Improvement of staff training is needed",Close to downtown,3.0,October 2023,"October 7, 2023",Double Room with Private Bathroom,2,Group,8.5
filthy - poorly mannered staff - no lockers in rooms - few outlets in rooms (had to charge at front desk overnight) wifi,"brutal accommodation - very filthy. staff are oddly unfriendly, the rooms do not have lockers, and minimal outlets (was on btm bunk and the outlet was only on the top?))
bathroom smelled like mould
the breakfast is… semi toasted toast with packets of low quality marmalade.
they do not have enough keys for the room so you have to share with guests",good location if you want to be close to the city centre,1.0,March 2022,"March 23, 2022",Single Bed in 4-Bed Dormitory Room with Internal Bathroom,3,Solo traveler,8.5
