"When I return to Lisbon, I will come to this hotel again",,"Super Hotel: Staff very polite and friendly, Only about 5 minutes walk from Metro, then about 5 stations to the city centre.

Great starting point for exploring Lisbon.,Nothing in particular.,"Like all Ibis hotels, this one offers a pleasant stay within a budget.

We had a nice stay!,"My only regret was paid parking :) But what to do - all spots outside were occupied. Anyway, no complains)","We booked this hotel for the first night in Lisbon before moving on to explore the country more and were very satisfied with our choice - hotel was 15mins drive from the airport but also close to the metro (that we used next day). Staff was very friendly and nice, checkin was pretty fast. Facilities at the hotel itself were great - water in the lobby for all guests, bar where one could have a drink and enjoy football, there was also another restaurant for breakfast but we didn't go there.
Room was just like in all Ibis Hotels around the world - comfortable beds, window with city view, TV, desk, etc... Bathroom with all amenities and shower.",9.0,June 2024,"June 28, 2024",Standard Double Room,1,Couple,8

Very Good,"The room only had a small window yet a huge curtain covering the wall and taking up space. I could not figure that out. Space was a limited resource in the room, so the counter space blocked by the curtain was annoying.","Location was close to two metro locations. It was a pleasant walk to the main shopping street and close to a couple grocery stores. Room always felt clean, staff were all very nice and helpful, and the included breakfast was great. We especially liked how late they served breakfast since we do not wake up early.",8.0,May 2024,"June 22, 2024",Standard Twin Room,5,Couple,8

Good place worth its money,"We enjoyed everything, however if you are sensitive to noise or are afraid of aeroplanes, you may opt the area out. This is because of the landing route of aeroplanes in Lisbon -  every plane landing in Lisbon would literally fly over the hotel roof quote close to the ground. This causes noise. This calms however down at night. However, if you are fascinated by watching planes, this disadvantage can turn into advantage =)","The room: the room was as pictured - a big comfy single bed, a corner wardrobe, a desk and a mini sitting area at the corner, and a TV. The shower was good with a good temperature and great water flow. It was nothing fancy but very comfortable, and we did not need to spend much time indoors as Lisbon was magnificent and worth spending the whole day out. 
The hotel and breakfast: the staff was very welcoming, and the hotel was clean. The breakfast had a few cheese and salami varieties, eggs, yoghurt with toppings, pastries including pasteis de nata, juices, coffee, and fruits. It was again nothing fancy but a good offer to kick the day off. As a bonus, you could take coffee and tea in take-away cups =) 
As a pleasant bonus, the common ironing area is on a top floor =)
The hotel is located in a non-touristic zone, with a 5 min walk to the nearest metro and roughly 10 min walk to the bus and train station Sete Rios, which is very convenient if you are travelling to other cities in Portugal.",8.0,May 2024,"May 26, 2024",Standard Double Room,3,Couple,8

Wonderful,"A bit noisy at times, especially if you like an open window as there is plane traffic.  Access to the hotel street is complicated as it is at the edge of an overpass and google repeatedly directed us at the back of the hotel (which meant a 5 minute walk and some steep stairs).","It is very close to the metro and a 10 minute ride to the center of Lisbon.  Very convenient if you travel by car, it has a big parking and there is plenty of street (paid) parking spots as well.  There is 24/7 bar and food service (good choice) but a bit on the pricey side.  There are some very good restaurants around.  The staff is very eager to assist.",9.0,March 2024,"April 23, 2024",Standard Double Room,3,Couple,8

Good location and place especially if you need to drive early morning to the airport.,,"Clean and exterior sound-proofed room, although it looked a bit old, close to the airport and close to a metro station (7 mins walk).
It is in a very safe area with many hotels, I also found parking available.",9.0,April 2024,"April 15, 2024",Standard Double Room,1,Family,8
Definitely our go-to hotel chain around Portugal,"We couldn't open the window and at the reception we were told nothing could be done until the morning (understandable since we were back to the hotel at about 2am) but the AC was also not working so the room got way too warm.
Also, in the elevators it says the restaurant runs 24/7, however when we asked about food options (at about 2am) the only thing available was toast. Again, understandable considering the time, but the info is a bit misleading. We were under the impression we could buy something at the hotel when back from a night out and that wasn't the case. Still, nothing too serious or damaging to the experience.","Amazing price-quality, the cleanliness of the room was great, the size of the room was great, bed was comfortable, staff made us feel welcome.

A good and practical choice for a cost effective short break in beautiful Lisbon.,The low pressure shower was disappointing (more  like home in Britain rather than the European norm) but that may have just been my room and nothing to rant to reception about.,Im quite happy staying with Ibis and this was no different. You know what youâre getting and it was clean.  The staff were super friendly and efficient. The location was convenient not in the centre of the city but about 10 minutes by metro from the main areas. The walk to the metro station is easy but quite lonely even during the day time. Its close to the airport so there is some flight noise but the advantage is that any car transfer doesnât involve crossing the city (which can be interesting during rush hours). For travellers who donât need everything right in front of the door and are happy to jump on public transport this is a good location. There is a buffet style continental breakfast served til 12 noon nothing fancy but fine for setting yourself up for the day. Book it when you get there as I was much cheaper at the hotel than booking in advance.,8.0,October 2023,"October 27, 2023",Standard Double Room,2,Solo traveler,8

Very Good,,"Really great for a budget hotel. Clean, modern room with plenty of storage and a nice en-suite. The lobby and bar area feel very modern and new.

There was a problem due to incorrect parking. They helped us solve it.",8.0,June 2023,"August 14, 2023",Standard Double Room,4,Couple,8
Overall Iâll give a 9/10 because it just keeps up to what they promise. They have got the main things with is: locke,"- Breakfast was not that great. Me and my husband payed 8.50 euros per person ( I think) for one day just to try it and it had croissants, bread, butter, ham, cheese and few other things like Pastel de Nata but it wasnât that good. You have to make your own orange juice which I think was unhygienic as I saw people touching the spinning thing of the juicer with their hands. We did miss a good toast with sausage and bacon but, you know, itâs Portugal and this is not the culture, so itâs fine. Overall Iâd give it a solid 6/10 for the breakfast.
- I wish they had more plugs in the rooms cause as far as I know there was just one extension with a couple plugs.
- The aircon could be stronger but it still sufficed and made us fresh in this hot august weather.
- Hairdryer could be better and stronger but it still worked.
- Wifi is good but not good if you need to attend a meeting when working remote.
- Didnât have an iron in the bedroom but Iâm pretty sure you can ask for it (I didnât use it) and no mini fridge (which would have been really useful) but apparently you can store things in a fridge in the common areas upon request (I also didnât check that).","- Staff very kind and helpful. We lost our keys once and forgot the keys inside another time and they took care of it in less than a minute.
- 24/7 bar and reception and it made us feel really safe whilst having a smoke outside, waiting for food delivery or waiting for an Uber.
- The location is in a really safe area (not that close to the city centre but you can easily get a 7 euro uber there).
- They have locks inside of the room that you can only lock from inside, good for solo travellers and girls specially that want to feel safer, no need to bring that extra locker.
- Bathroom, room, bed and bedding, everything super clean and they have got shampoo/conditioner, body wash and hand soap for you.
- Bed really comfy and not noisy
- They have got lockers if you need to keep your bag there if you check out but you only leave at night for example.
- walls are not that thin so you donât really hear everyone.",9.0,August 2023,"August 14, 2023",Standard Double Room,6,Couple,8

It served its purpose. In and Out!,"The two small pillows for two adults. Perhaps this is on me, but I requested two pillows while booking through Booking.com and did not follow up during check-in. I arrived late and just wanted to sleep. The parking garage also has to be the tightest area I have ever driven.

Disappointed with the state of IBIS Lisboa Jose Malhoa,"NO WATER PRESSURE: Stayed on the 12 floor, had to jump around the shower to get wet (No pressure at all). Was told by front desk gentlemen that it's because it's the 12 floor. I did not ask for a 12 floor room so demanded a different room on a lower level. (ROOM 1221)

AIR CONDITIONER NOT WORKING/NO STENGTH: We were then moved to the 2nd floor, shower pressure was good but air conditioner had no strength, or this is what we were told by the Maintenace/Service gentlemen. This room was hot and would take a long time to cool down. So Maintenace/Service gentlemen asked that we move once again. (ROOM - not sure of room number)

BED BUG: We were then moved to the 7th floor. Water pressure and air conditioner was good at last. At 4am was woken by something biting me on my neck.  I thought it was a mosquito but was shocked to find that it was a bed bug. 
IBIS group can't afford to have bed bugs in one of their branches - health risk. Not sure if it was because I used the spare cushion. (ROOM 713)

Not good value for the price - has some good features but could do a lot better.,"The reception team were not very interested, and a little distracted.

The breakfast was pretty limited, as was the evening menu (all microwaved food).  Not that it could be helped of course, but the hotel is directly underneath the flight path for the airport and the windows are not particularly soundproofed.  The hotel in general felt a bit tired and run down.  We were staying in that part of Lisbon as we had an appointment nearby.  As we presume this is mainly a transit hotel (itÂ´s very close to the airport), the hotel does not succeed in providing a good nightÂ´s rest and something tasty and filling to eat.

That was a fraudulent way to overcharge me. Because I use Wise to avoid that situations where I don't need to pay in Swedish to avoid expensive charges from the locals. 

I never had that problem again, the rest of the Portugueses let me choose in all types of shops where I buy my chosen currency - EURO. So that I avoided extra charges, but that bitter moment made me not to choose that hotel again in the future and I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.

Disappointing.,Initially when we arrived at the reception the staff asked to change to room to another room than we were allocated earlier. As the staff mentioned that the room is same we changed it without thinking. We just dropped our luggage and went out to visit the city. All hell broke loose when we came back to the hotel. The room was stinking like crazy and the room had a very negative and depressing vibe. The smell was so bad that we decided shorten our stay from 3 night to 1 night. I requested the night staff to change our room but the staff did not provide another room during the first request. I thought of settling down in the room but the smell was so bad that we could not stand it. Again I requested the staff to change the room and told that we are going to leave the hotel as next day. The staff understood the gravity of the problem and arranged another better room for 1 night. Eventually we moved to another hotel the next day. It was a really disappointing stay.,The night staff gave another room.,1.0,May 2022,"May 30, 2022",Double Room with Extra Bed,3,Family,8

I have never seen this is as normally guests carry a few of their leftover breakfast items back to their rooms. The room size is so small that there is no space left for keeping bags or moving.","The location was good, but only one market Auchan nearby. Metro is close by.

And then the experience with a possible fire at 11pm was a very bad experience.

The fireman expend more than three hours to detect where the issue and the alarm were.

I recommend this not only for budget-conscious travelers,the beds were too narrow. but it's negligible,price. Good value for the price. Staff very nice and helpful. I also loved the breakfast. The hotel makes an effort to serve fresh food: you can make freshly-squeezed orange juice and even pancakes. They also have a wide array of fruits and a GrabnGo coffee. I like that hotel makes you feel that you get so much more than what you paid for. It gives guests a good feeling.,8.0,September 2022,"September 22, 2022",Standard Twin Room,3,Group,8
