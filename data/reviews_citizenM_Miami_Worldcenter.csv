++ The unique central and absolutely private location in downtown next to the Freedom Tower on the beach and two stations of the Metromover. It's cheap and easy to get from the airport to the hotel and quickly to the Metrorail.
++ Although the rooms are not large, they were the most practically furnished ever. A spacious safe and a large drawer for 2 suitcases beneath the bed keep things organized and make it extremely easy to organize a full-day trip. It's very easy to keep your passports and a back-up of money, credit cards etc. completely safe.
++ As a european you will feel like you have arrived in America. The curtains, the lights, the television and the air conditioning can be controlled with a small Apple I-PAD. Really American, I was really impressed!
++ The reception area is very modern and very cozy, very lovingly and lovingly designed. With wonderful books and sophisticated games. It has a great bar with a plentiful selection of (alcoholic) drinks. Food and prices are typical US-American, you have to adapt to that.
++ The rooftop bar on the eleventh floor with the infinity pool was absolutely stunning! Its size was somewhat limited, but thanks to the counter-current system you could swim well! You had an amazing view of the harbor and downtown. You felt like you were in heaven and really accepted into the family of skyscrapers.
++ Always an extremely relaxed atmosphere with the fellow guests and personnel. And very convenient, the automated check-in, where you can select the location of the room.",10,July 2024,"July 9, 2024",King Room,4,Solo traveler,8.9

Comfortable stay at a hotel located in what I thought was a great place.,"Realistically, I didn‚Äôt not have anything that stuck out to me as being particularly disliked. In regards to the king sized bed, it is not a king sized room, if that makes sense lol. However, the rooms are accurately advertised on the website and through booking.com. What you see is pretty much exactly what you get. It worked for me, anyone expecting any more will be disappointed.","The hotel has a very modern vibe; every room has a king sized bed, is ipad controlled, and honestly decorated in a nice modern minimalistic look. You pay for what you get, however, so they do not clean the rooms every day. That being said, you can pay extra for cleaning to come.

Perfect location! Great Vibe! Good Food! Small rooms.,"I was expecting a small room but not smaller like this. It was perfect for me and my husband taking in consideration that we booked just for a weekend, however if I coming for a whole week or from another country with big or lot of luggage, I won‚Äôt be happy with the size of the room. Is Not in my knowledge is they offer bigger rooms. This is the only reason I took away 1 point from 10. Everything else it was perfect.","Since you put your feet at the front door you can feel a great welcoming vibe that I really liked. The staff was amazing, helpful and very approachable. The hotel offers the option to hold your luggage ‚Äòtill your check-in time and also offers to hold your luggage after check-out. That was perfect for me and my husband because we could spent more time in the city. The hotel/rooms operated in smart-tech way. Very modern. The pool area is so beautiful, with different areas to stay and the view is great! Is a bar there too but it wasn‚Äôt open early during the day. Something else we LOVED, it was the breakfast. Even when is not included, worth it. The quality and well served of the food impressed me. Finally, the location.

For some people I'm sure this isn't an issue but I think at least one cup of coffee should be included in any hotel stay.","The location is a little strange, as in, there isn't so much to do that is within walking distance. However, it was close to the port which is what we needed. It's also really close to the free public transit train thing. Everything else was great - it was a bit more modern than I was expecting, but the rooftop pool was great, the bed was comfy.",9.0,October 2023,"December 4, 2023",King Room - Bay View,3,Group,8.9

Comfortable stay at a hotel located in what I thought was a great place.,"Realistically, I didn‚Äôt not have anything that stuck out to me as being particularly disliked. In regards to the king sized bed, it is not a king sized room, if that makes sense lol. However, the rooms are accurately advertised on the website and through booking.com. What you see is pretty much exactly what you get. It worked for me, anyone expecting any more will be disappointed.","The hotel has a very modern vibe; every room has a king sized bed, is ipad controlled, and honestly decorated in a nice modern minimalistic look. You pay for what you get, however, so they do not clean the rooms every day. That being said, you can pay extra for cleaning to come. It was a great stay for a solo traveler such as myself, or those looking for ample accommodations on work-related travels. Also, the entire place was very clean, staff was friendly, and the breakfast and food options were good!",9.0,November 2023,"December 1, 2023",King Room,2,Solo traveler,8.9

Perfect location! Great Vibe! Good Food! Small rooms.,"I was expecting a small room but not smaller like this. It was perfect for me and my husband taking in consideration that we booked just for a weekend, however if I coming for a whole week or from another country with big or lot of luggage, I won‚Äôt be happy with the size of the room. Is Not in my knowledge is they offer bigger rooms. This is the only reason I took away 1 point from 10. Everything else it was perfect.","Since you put your feet at the front door you can feel a great welcoming vibe that I really liked. The staff was amazing, helpful and very approachable. The hotel offers the option to hold your luggage ‚Äòtill your check-in time and also offers to hold your luggage after check-out. That was perfect for me and my husband because we could spent more time in the city. The hotel/rooms operated in smart-tech way. Very modern. The pool area is so beautiful, with different areas to stay and the view is great! Is a bar there too but it wasn‚Äôt open early during the day. Something else we LOVED, it was the breakfast. Even when is not included, worth it. The quality and well served of the food impressed me. Finally, the location. Is In front to the arena, next to the metromover, and just a few steps from the Bayside area and the bus stops if you‚Äôre interested to go to Miami Beach.",9.0,November 2023,"November 27, 2023",King Room,1,Couple,8.9

"Not for everyone but if it's for you, you'll love it. Check it out.",Leaving. I wanted to stay. I could live in this hotel if the rooms come with kitchens. Maybe have a better bar menu. The breakfast bacon was thick bacon and I like thin.,"This hotel is not for everyone as the rooms are small and some people don't like tech and gadgets. But, I loved it. 
It's a great location. You check yourself in and it's easy. There's human help if you need it. The lobby is like a very large living constructed so people can work on their laptops and devices. The elevators are fast as is the WiFi. The place is super clean.
The rooms are small but they have everything you need. The temperature, TV, lights, and blinds are all controlled by a provided iPad. You can even change the colors of your lighting and set your own ambiance to the room. The shower is a standup and can snugly fit two people. The sink is in the main room. The bed is big enough for two people. There is a small desk provided but you'd rather work in the lobby/living room because it's so nice. 
At the Miami location, breakfast is about $20 and it's good and has all the usual stuff you'll find in a hotel buffet breakfast. The coffee is very good.
You also get two drink vouchers when you check in. There's also a rooftop pool and bar.

The best thing about the place is the staff. The people are so freaking nice. They never treat you like a burden. They treat you like a friend and if you stay long enough, you get to know them. I loved meeting and talking to Ace, Annie, Jeffrey, and Shekayama (I probably messed that one up). SO NICE! One of them even gave me a going-away gift.

I don't give glowing reviews like this. I really did love this place. In all my future travels, I will be looking for CitizenM.",10,June 2023,"June 18, 2023",King Room,2,Solo traveler,8.9

"We had a great stay pre cruise , enjoyed the property and location a lot.","Not having a traditional check in desk. There was a computer glitch at the time so checking in took awhile cause there were only 2 people helping with the computers, with multiple guests trying to check in all the same time.","This hotel was very unique. We enjoyed everything about the property. Rooms were small but worked for the 2 of us. We thought it was really cool to control the room with the iPad. We had a city view directly across from the Miami Heat Arena. The dark out shades were unbelievable and blocked out all the city lights. The led lighting in the bathroom was also another cool affect. the beds were comfortable, though we were a little skeptical with having the bed pushed up one side against the window. Rooftop Pool area was on the smaller side, but again worked perfectly. it was a nice touch when the bartender I believed passed out small cups of gelato to the pool guests. The complimentary Citizens M tote bags came in handy for the pool too. Location was very close to the cruise port and to Bayside marketplace. There‚Äôs a 24 hr CVS located on the corner across the street, that was very convenient to pick up sunscreen etc. There was also food and a package store located inside the CVS. Only downfall were the amount of homeless people hanging out around the property, made walking a little uncomfortable.

"Perfect for solo or couples, with a great location and modern facilities.","- Breakfast was overpriced for what was available. 
- Pool bar should be open during the day when it would be utilised for drinks and snacks. As it currently opens at 4.30pm we only got to order one set of drinks before the sun went down and we packed up.
- Food ordering from the app/iPad was ""turned off"" during our stay. That would be an excellent addition to this feature.
- Better info for staff on how to utilise private south beach access and what that includes. Staff member we spoke to had to ask a colleague, who then said we go to their location at 100 Lincoln road and just tell them we are staying at citizenM. We went into the hotel at that address as we were unsure what to do, but was shooed away by unhelpful person to just go out to the beach. We asked at the first stand and were told ""No. Citizen M is pink & white."" We finally got over to the pink and white section and was asked for 30 for two, until we said we were CitizenM guests, and then they said chairs & towels are free but umbrella is 20.
- (Despite these notes I would stay again.)","- Super location. Perfect for us hopping on the metro mover, getting the bus to South Beach, or ordering a pick-up to the hotel front set-down area.
- Comfy bed and pillow. Not too soft, as I have a bad back that needs support, but not too firm either. Slept great!
- Good wifi and casting capabilities to tv, both chromecast and Airplay.
- Friendly staff.
- iPad in each room for controlling everything, as well as the downloadable app for phone. Cool and handy feature.
- This includes option to set days you want housekeeping to come
- Perfect facilities for working - MacBooks downstairs; plenty of seating with tray tables for laptops; nooks with single seating and power sockets; great indoor/outdoor/poolside seating areas on the rooftop with beautiful views.

While that is strange since so many laser printers copy, scan and print, she also did not offer a solution, such as pointing me to any print shop nearby. When asked if there was one, she simply said she didn't know and did not offer to look for one. When asked if she could look for one or ask her colleagues, she put me on hold and never returned.

I liked the concept and the high tech and the VERY space efficient rooms and common spaces. Feels very European and nothing like your typical US chain hotels. Young and hip western European travelors will love it!   Highly recommend especially if they keep the price in l8ne with the amenities.

"Amazing- loved the art, loved the space and loved the vibe.  Looking forward to more stays soon!","Not much- I would say you should go into it knowing the room will be small.   Another thing to be aware of is the lights are eco friendly in the hallways, so when you first get off the elevator or open your door, the hallway is dark- the lights turn on when motion is detected.  Its also important to note that this hotel has a pop art aesthetic, which means you will see a lot of bright colors, some art that some might consider offensive (we did not- we LOVED all of it, but if you are a little more uptight, I can see this being an issue) and the general vibe is very much geared toward older Gen Z and Millennials.   Not the best for kids or older couples who are looking for a more conservative place.","Breakfast was great- they were very accommodating and obtained a gluten free option for me when it was not available right away.  Check in was a breeze and the room was perfect for a home base.  Even though it was small, the layout makes smart use of the space.

Very nice stay in Miami Downtown,"The bathroom is very little and made just o the shower and the toilette. The sink is in the room. There is no privacy when you use the toilette since the plastic wall around the bathroom is kind of thin and a bit transparent. If you are with your couple is ok, but if you are with a friend could be a bit uncomfortable. 
There is no parking available at the hotel. On their website it is adviced to check Parking Hero website to book for a parking nearby, please be aware that this website is quite expensive, I booked online and once I got at the parking the man at the entrance would have charged me less than half the price I had already paid. I suggest to get to Miami and go stright to the parking lots, prices are better on the spot than online.","Very nice and modern hotel. The interior is super well decored and the room as well was super nice. We had the room on the 7th floor, so from our window we could see the Miami Arena and the Bayfront, super lovely. The room is comfortable but quite small for two people. The swimming pool on the 12th floor was closed but it would open in just few weeks time and it looked stunning. The hotel is located super conveniently next to the Metromover station, which is a foc train to move in the downtown area. Just 10 minutes walking from the Hotel there is the Bayfront area with lots of shops and restaurants and the hop off and hop on bus stop.

Unsatisfactory Experience For The Price,"Felt more like a number than as if I was welcomed there. The ""Futurama"", automation approach of check-in and check-out was too hands off for me. Not enough friendly, human interaction. When my fiancee and I got to our room, it was teeny tiny like a one bedroom studio apartment in lower Manhattan NY. The bed was right up against the wall on the left hand side meaning only one way of access in and out of the bed so the person on the left hand side would have to climb over the person on the right to use the restroom. When I asked the gentleman downstairs about if every room was designed this way, he just laughed and said yes in a joking, non professional manner. I wasn't too happy about being mocked! The other thing about the bed was that the mattress was too firm and hurt our backs. No coffee maker in the room which meant I couldn't have my usual morning cup of coffee which I treasure. Everything including breakfast was an additional upcharge and not included with the already overpriced cost of our two night stay there. Lastly, my Fiancee and I ordered tacos through Uber Eats one night and not one single employee at the front desk was courteous enough to call up to our room to kindly let us know the driver was not allowed to deliver directly to our room and that we'd have to come downstairs to retrieve our grub. Overall, a negative experience that I would recommend anybody think twice about before booking a stay here for a getaway.üëé","Honestly, not much about this particular hotel that I liked as I will mention in detail in the next question.

Any noises, ""pounding"" or cleaning in the neihbouring rooms will be heard uncomfortably loud. Good breakfast but after 2 days it gets boring. Don't expect the staff to be attentive nor personal, in Miami everyone is doing their own thing and this staff left a lackluster impression, bar staff were less than stellar being patient to understand my accent as a brown Caribbean person and the lightning in the hallways is very creepy.","Excellent location, beautifully designed and great rooftop party atmosphere",4.0,April 2024,"April 8, 2024",King Room - Bay View,2,Solo traveler,8.9

- We got there about midnight and it took us more than half hour to park. The attendant gave us the wrong address after checking with several people. We circled around 4-5 times on one-way blocks multiple times. We requested someone drive with us and they refused.

I then walked to the bar and asked for the manager‚Ä¶ I told him about the AC not working and how someone walked in on me in my room. He said he could give me another room but if he turned on the AC it effects every room and everyone would complain!! He told me it was not their fault that someone walked into my room and ignored how visibly upset I was. He then moved me to room 652, the AC still did not work. I had to get a box fan from CVS to use during my stay, which is ridiculous when you are paying over $200 a night for a hotel!!!!

Do NOT recommend. Will NEVER stay there again.,"Hotel rooms are minuscule. OK only for one person. Not enough room for more than one person. Room is only as wide as the length of a bed. The beds are pushed up against the window and fit between between two walls so that if there are two people in a room, one has to climb over the other person in order to get up. There is no room to walk around the bed. The only rooms where you can walk around the bed on both sides of the bed and the rooms for disabled persons. There are no bedside tables, only very very small shelf. You have to use a iPad to manage everything- even to turn on the TV and it is easy to drop it which would cost the person a lot of money to replace. The shower was cold and didn‚Äôt drain well. The pool only gets sun for a few hours in the morning because a building blocks the sun making it impossible to enjoy all day thus it is not worth paying for a hotel with a pool. There is no concierge or help desk, only a row of computers where you have to do self check-in and check-out.

I wouldn‚Äôt stay here again!,"Very poor customer service. When we first booked this hotel. It was under my significant other name.

I showed my ID as well as made the payment for the days in which I would be staying there. On the 4th night of my stay I lost my room key so I went to the help desk to ask for help to get a new one. I was told that my name wasn‚Äôt on the account and even though upon arrival my ID was scanned and they can see that I paid with my card in the system. They still refused to allow me back to my room and stated that my name wasn‚Äôt on the room so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to go back to my room and they wouldn‚Äôt be able to refund me because of my name not being on the room even though when I first arrived, there employee stated he added my name to the room and took payment from me. Instead of when I first arrived stating that I would need to make a new reservation since my name wasn‚Äôt the primary holder. The employee was extremely rude telling, they didn‚Äôt take any accountability even though it was a mistake on there end since the employee stated he added my name to the rooms. They never apologized for the inconvenience or anything. I asked for a manager still never seen the manager because the following day they stated she was in a meeting. The hotel is nice even though it‚Äôs small but the workers are extremely rude and management is worst because they knew the issue and never even came to help but instead sent someone with lack of knowledge to assist which wasn‚Äôt resolved.

Hightech Hotel missing Humanity at Checkout desk,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at this hotel, and while the accommodations themselves were satisfactory, I am disappointed to report that my experience with the hotel staff was less than pleasant.

During check-in, I found the staff at the front desk to be quite rude, which set an unfortunate tone for the rest of my stay. To make matters worse, when I attempted to inquire about the checkout process, I was repeatedly ignored by a particular staff member, despite my requests for assistance. Eventually, after several minutes of attempting to get her attention, she reluctantly addressed my concerns.

Unfortunately, this interaction only further soured my experience, as I was informed that the price I had been quoted for my stay was incorrect and that I would need to pay additional fees. Additionally, I was informed that there was no option to pay in cash, which was an inconvenience.

To add insult to injury, I was disappointed to learn that during the ultra weekend, the hotel was blocking guest friends  from accessing the bar or changing their clothes. While it was still possible to find a way in, this was a major letdown for me, as I was looking forward to enjoying the amenities the hotel had to offer.

Overall, while the hotel itself was fine, I cannot recommend it due to the poor service I received from the staff. It is clear that the staff could benefit from additional training in how to work with guests and provide a more positive experience. Until these issues are addressed, I will not be returning to this hotel.",,4.0,April 2023,"April 2, 2023",King Room,6,Solo traveler,8.9

Never again,"The room was extremely small, poorly laid out, and lacked bathroom privacy with the toilet placed in the middle of the room behind barely frosted glass. The sink counter was strangely sloped in a funnel so that everything placed on it kept rolling into sink. The bed orientation required that my companion crawl over me to get in and out. There was no help at the front desk when we arrived mid-day and we were forced to ask the bartender for assistance. The kiosk check-in was awful and failed multiple times even after someone besides the bartender arrived to help. The room controls were confusing and difficult to use. One of the colored lights in the room kept flashing all night and nothing worked to shut it off. The hallways were dark red and very poorly lit making it difficult to see or even read the room numbers.

Fair,"Unfortunately during our one night stay we booked our room and had to end up switching prior to even getting accustomed to the room. The AC in both the first room, and the second room we stayed in both wasn‚Äôt working as it should have. Now, it is my fault for not addressing the issue about the second room but being in Miami and enjoying the Wynwood art district by the time we made it back to the room they moved us into I was too tired to even tell anyone at the front desk and I didn‚Äôt want to come off as rude. Both settings were set at 64 degrees for hours on end and the room probably stayed at a steady 73-70. I do enjoy my rooms to be super chilly especially with how comfortable and thick the blanket was in the room it would‚Äôve been nice to not feel too hot once we had opened the blinds in the morning with the sun beaming inside. Also, I did take a video of the shower because in our second room the shower did have a couple leaks in the bottom which in turn leaked onto the vinyl wood flooring. I only wanted to address this not for any issue other than it may just need extra caulking. Lastly I‚Äôd like to address the ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù issue. Although the staff was lovely and WILLING to help, I had to approach quite a few of the employees to ask for assistance about things that should‚Äôve been addressed beforehand. other than a couple issues the stay overall was good.",I liked the overall design of the hotel.
