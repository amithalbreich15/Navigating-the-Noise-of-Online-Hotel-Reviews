Exceptional,,"Exceptional location. Right at a busy square called oktogon square. Easy access to Public transport system like Tram, Buses, Metro and taxis all the time.
Breakfast is good enought to start your day with coffee, boiled eggs, cereals, breads and spreads.",10,October 2023,"October 31, 2023",Quadruple Room with Private Bathroom,4,Group,8.2
Wonderful,The airconditioning in the rooms didn't work so it was super hot at night during the summer heatwave in Budapest.,The free breakfast and the cleanliness of the place was great! The kitchen was also very good and held clean. The common areas where also nice and the staff was nice.,9.0,August 2024,"August 20, 2024",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,5,Solo traveler,8.2
"Great value for money, wonderful location.","Rooms were tidy, but the combined shower/toilet on my floor was a little tight. If possible it would have been better if they were separated, seeing as we were several guests on that floor sharing those facilities. 

I was also unsure of the sheets. Even though it was nice to come to a made bed, I think I would prefer to get sheets from the reception so I as a guest can really feel that they are newly washed. I had no reason to question it, but I just prefer it generally.","Super central, easy to get around and the overall impression was really nice. It’s a shame the courtyard is not what it looked like on the pictures; if there were like an inside garden with the possibility to sit outside and have drinks, that would for sure be give extra points!",8.0,August 2024,"August 17, 2024",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room with Standard Bunk Beds,1,Solo traveler,8.2

Would definitely come back!,"My room was facing the square and we opened it due to a many people being in the dorm, so it was a bit louder at night.","The hostel is located ideally in the Octagon Square in Pest, so it is easy to reach every destination in Budapest, even by foot. Hostel staff was nice and beds were totally fine, also lots of space in the rooms and the hostel overall, also comes with free breakfast! I didn't use the options for meeting up with people, but I can imagine it is an ideal hostel for finding travel partners as well.",8.0,May 2024,"August 15, 2024",Bed in 12-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,1,Solo traveler,8.2
Very Good,,Kumar Amrendra held a guide tour for me and a few other travelers.

A great location within the city,The room that I stayed in on the third floor has 8 beds and they are connected right next to one another. This made it difficult when someone was rocking their bed constantly and then when they make loud noise in their sleep too. I’m not sure what happened from the time that I initially arrived the room felt climate controlled but later within the week it became much more warm. Unfortunately a small group visiting to attend a music festival on a daily basis would serve themselves alcoholic drinks and play their music loudly in the kitchen area on the third floor. Knowing that this was happening it would had been thoughtful for someone from the reception desk to make the group aware that the environment on the third floor is space being used by other guests too not just their group. Their isn’t a dedicated quiet place to study or work so it leaves a person to have to decide on which common area between the three floors is most suitable for them to use.,Each designated kitchen area is well organized and meets many needs for what you could need when preparing a meal. The bathrooms are adequate. The cleaning staff does a detailed work to keep areas throughout the hostel immaculate and the staff that each morning prepares a light breakfast for the guests are very accommodating for the hostel as well. Where the hostel is located at Oktogon nearby a tram is convenient for getting around the city.,8.0,August 2024,"August 13, 2024",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,7,Solo traveler,8.2
Wonderful,"Breakfast is really simple. Toast, jam, butter, cucumber, tomato, paprika, egg(hard to peel off), milk, oatmeal, tea
There is some yellow stain on the bedsheet. The quilt smells nice.","The lobby has AC. Four-people room has AC. It is really cool. Two rooms share two bathroom. We also have our private kitchen. (microwave, toaster, kettle and induction stove) It is really nice. (8 people-room do not have AC)
You can use the locker to store your luggage. It is safer. The luggage room does not have a door. You might be careful whether someone stole it.
The staff cleans the table often and refill the food regularly. They provide enough papers on each table.
It has a lift.

I loved this place. Everything was not a problem.,"Well, I really can't think of anything!","The building was old, but clean, tidy, organised, and my dorm room was great! The site was in the middle of all the traffic and action, but it was very quiet and peaceful inside the rooms. Staff were very friendly and very helpful.
Breakfast was included. Lots of good food to keep me going for a few hours out and about.
The kitchen dishes system worked well and was well supervised. Because everyone was doing their bit, everyone benefitted.
Buying an evening meal was an easy option if one wanted to take advantage of it, but there was also a perfectly good, quiet mini kitchen next to my dorm, with everything one would need to whip up some small meal, or stay up late quietly planning the next day, without disturbing anyone.
Organised evening entertainment and fun things to do was a great feature. 
Having a light and spacious lounge area in the middle of everything was lovely. It made the place welcoming and very much less lonely.
This was a great introduction to my first adventure as a solo traveller in a foreign country.",8.0,July 2024,"August 8, 2024",Bed in 10-Bed Female Dormitory Room with Private Bathroom,2,Solo traveler,8.2

Fantastic! Very glad I chose this hostel,"The free included breakfast was lackluster, but I guess it's ok if you're starving in the morning. Definitely not bad - didn't make me sick and it was a nice comfort to have, but I ended up eating out both because Budapest is cheap and because there wasn't really much to the breakfast.","It was brilliant! The friendliest staff, very social experience around the hostel, even though I'm quite a big person the bed was spacious (8 person capsule room). Very much recommend and would definitely come there at F1 time next year!
Also considering it was summertime the room was ventilated well enough that heat didn't feel like a problem when going to sleep which I was afraid it might be.",9.0,July 2024,"July 28, 2024",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Capsule-Style Dormitory Room with Private Bathroom,4,Solo traveler,8.2

Good hostel especially if going solo,Breakfast could have been a little better if they had just sole cheese and salami/ meat slices. Because with current options it doesn't feel like much.,"Nice location, the hostel has a good vibe, they add you to a WhatsApp group so you can meet and hangout with other people from the hostel on those days, being a solo traveller that was an amazing option for me to meet people and go partying with.

"Great place for exploring Budapest, good atmosphere and amenities","I picked this hostel because of the curtains on the bed, and was pretty sure that I specifically selected a room with such pictures, but it turns out there are also many dorms that don't have it, and that's what I got. This could have been clearer. Those standard beds were very squeaky, any tiny move would make a lot of noise. 

AC was unfortunately broken and that was bad timing, cause it was +30 degrees the whole time. Luckily after the first night we got a fan which helped a lot. 

There seemed to be few toilets for the amounts of people, 2 shared ones on my floor with I think 4 dorms, it was often a long waiting time. 

As a few small suggestions, I would maybe add a mirror in the rooms, hooks on the beds. Would also be great for breakfast to have maybe cheese and ham for putting on bread.","I really enjoyed my stay here. The place had a great location, great facilities, and shops and public transport close by. Everything was clean, comfy bed, decently sized locker (though needs own padlock), also hooks in the room, personal light and socket. The breakfast is included and has a decent selection, and the hostel also offers free dinner if you spend 4€ in the bar, which was really nice. Because of this I didn't end up using the kitchens, but they seemed in order, also there were many fridges. Staff was ok friendly overall, but some could be more engaged or knowledgeable about their own hostel and activities. I liked that there were people of all ages and interests, so could find likeminded company.",9.0,June 2024,"July 6, 2024",Bed in 6-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room with Standard Bunk Beds,3,Solo traveler,8.2

You should have it on you or borrow it from the reception. That was my only inconvenient.

I would like to say thank you to the staff for their warm reception!

take a closer look at the staff at the reception. It seems like they are doing you a favor when you contact them.,"One of the huge minuses is the receptionist. If I'm not mistaken, the name is Moral - she's very rude and never smiles. It so happened that one of the excursions that I booked was canceled at the last moment and I returned to the hostel upset, I decided to consult with her about what else I could see and how to get where - she answered Google it and turned away. I also repeatedly heard complaints about her from other hostel guests. but what surprised me most was when I wanted to do a check-out and my taxi to the airport was waiting for me downstairs - she said I don’t have time, I’m waiting until the night shift comes to replace me. I said that I had a plane in 3 hours and heard in response - I told you to wait, I don’t have time. so this employee is the only negative impression. Otherwise everything was fine.","First of all, I want to say a huge thank you to our guide for an interesting and fascinating tour of the city🙏🏼 I really liked the way he told it with humor and interesting facts, I advise everyone who stays in the hostel to join the walking tours.

Wonderful,"Experience varies from to room. This review is for my this stay and room only. The idea of capsule bed is interesting. But design had a flaw - the metal decorations were dangerous on the lowest level because of the locker - when you kneel down and stand up you might hit your head, which happened with my roommate. The room was small, so not comfortable to move around and to keep luggage. Fortunately the room had spare connected room where I kept luggage. There was an issue with my locker.

Great stay yet again. We have stayed here before and would 100 percent book again.  Great location.,"No advisory for guests leaving early in the morning not to pack their bags on top of the top bunk as it will shake the whole structure and awake everyone.

Please pack the night before or do it on the floor.","We have stayed at this hostel before.. but this time we stayed in a different room type.

We liked fhat our room had a fridge and a small kitchen area this time as we could spend our day at the nearby thermal baths and then just jump home to the hostel and make ourselves a snack meal (saving money and also time) before grabbing a shower and heading to bed.   After spending the day at the spa we were exhausted.

The beds have privacy curtain around them that make it almost like a capsule hotel like set up.

There's WiFi and there are cupboards..  but you do need to bring your own padlock for these or buy one.

We had no issues except for one night when some room mates staying in the top bunks decided to come home late cook at 11pm and then proceed to pack and unpack at 4am in fhe morning on top of the bunks.. meaning fhat everyone was disturbed..  they left at 5am and everyone got to sleep again.

Every other night was more or less peaceful and undisturbed... but fhis is always fhe risk of booking a shared room.

I recommend using fhe privacy curtain and using earplugs and you should be okay.

Have your booking on your phone for when you arrive as you'll be asked for it.  First time this has happened to me for a while as I usually book online and just give my name on arrival.

It was nice fhat the hostal now offer sandwiches all day round at reception for 1 euro.. so you can arrive even without the local currency and have something affordable to eat.

This made a big difference for us as we arrived late at night.

You also need to give a 5 euro deposit for your room key but we were aware of this as we stayed here before.

Would recommend and would book to stay again.",8.0,February 2024,"February 11, 2024",3 Beds in 12-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,3,Family,8.2

"It's worth staying here, at least for a few days, to see if it's worth coming back (4th time here)","The space in the room is quite smallish, with all six persons here it can be a bit tight. If you get the upper bed, the process of getting up may be a bit difficult - the position of the ladder is not very effortless and requires some acrobatic skills from you 😀

The room can be a bit muggy and hot, so during the night I recommend opening the window a bit to let fresh air flow 😴","🙂 I am staying here for the fourth time (price - quality - location ratio); for the first time in a 6-Bed mixed Capsule-Style dormitory. The windows overlook the inner courtyard, so this is an option for those who like silence: you can't hear any street noise at all. This room is on the 2nd floor, but you can still use the guest kitchen one floor above.

☕️ In the morning, there is a breakfast option (included in the price): without cheese and meat, but still a filling meal so you can eat plenty.

🚿 Despite the hostel being almost full there were no queues for either the toilets or the showers (if everything is occupied on your floor, it's worth checking on another one).

🚪 The main entrance and stairs are being renovated, so it may be a bit inconvenient. Therefough results are already visible: the unsightly inscriptions in the corridor have been removed and the walls have been painted.

Fun and friendly atmosphere and amazing location.,"The bed mattresses were a little thin, but not a major issue. Still plenty supportive unless you sleep on your side all night. 

The bathroom had some major funk smells. Believe it was from the drains. Easily mitigated by closing the bathroom door. Just not great to go in to use the bathroom. 

Breakfast time was really busy with shoulder to shoulder people walking around. Not a big problem if you’re ok with this atmosphere, but could be unpleasant for some.","Can beat the location in downtown Budapest. Super value deal.

"If it were not for the Red Head girl, the short bar tender, okay.","There was a red head girl at the front desk I did not like because she was often ride with me and other guests and did not speak to me or offer any help with my registration. However, after visiting Budapest for several days and interacting with people in Budapest, she is the typical Hungarian who is rude, unkind, and aloof.

Lights on in the middle of the night, slamming with doors, watching movies without earphones. Noisy and arrogant. Not what you expect while staying at a hostel. Different vibe at the dormitries.

It seems like (for some people) it's just a ""cheap hotel"" and they are not looking for the cozy hostel, sadly.",5th time in Budapest and I always take a different location.

Very good stay for me.,"The elevator. On my both visits, the elevator had limited use - not working from 1st to till ground floor - you have to pickup luggage on your own upstairs. And the floors are quite high.  It's not the hostel's issue - but the buildings, however, a traveler needs to keep in mind this. Same inside the hostel  - no elevator to the rooms upstairs.
The WC, shower count is very limited. There are quite many rooms, beds, so it's causing some difficulty to be have to waited long.","I like this hostel in overall - the location, the spacious area, breakfast availability.

Fantastic stay. I will miss it.,The only thing I can say about the stay is that the noise of the ambulances is very irritating. But after a few days you get used to it and it's not like it's the hostels fault.,"Had a magnifique holiday! The staff has been very nice from day one. Everything was as expected. Clean rooms, showers, toilets... 
Very friendly people working in the hostel. 
They preserve dinner (even vegetarian option).
Had a lot of fun during the activities at the bar (drinking games, darts, kahoot...). 
Great energy which leads to a great atmosphere within the hostel. 
I went out a lot with Sébastian (walking tour guide) and Andrès (Bartender) to local clubs. Party guaranteed with those guys. I can say we even became friends :). You can tell it's important for them to please the guests and give them a good time. 
I also met 2 girl bartenders who just arrived there to volonteer in the hostel. They are from the Netherlands and they are called Loes and Eliette. Very friendly bartenders also. They don't hesitate to have a chat with you when you order a drink and they always smile.

I stayed in a 10- or 12-bed dorm and the room was big enough and did not feel crammed. Showers and toilets as well as a kitchen were right outside of my room. It was never too busy so I never had to wait to use these facilities and there was plenty of room in the fridge. Breakfast is complimentary but as an early bird I always left the hostel before 7am so I cannot give more information on the breakfast.

3rd time staying in this hostel,"Yes, indeed, I stand by the opinions of guests who have experienced the heat this year. Even though I was there in mid-September, the temperatures reached +30. There is an AC in the 6-bed dorm and it works, but it's weak, so we had the windows open almost all the time, which, of course, added to the street noise. There was a fan in the room, which was enough for a 6-person room (although it makes a lot of noise).

The breakfast is filling (there's plenty to choose from), but it still lacks some meat or cheese.","The main advantages of the Avenue Hostel are the location (metro Oktogon line 1, tram #4 & #6 stop, not far from railway station Nyugati, close to the city centre), attractive price, breakfast included option. I must admit that the quality of coffee for breakfast has improved.

Good and stable Wi-Fi signal, kitchenette (if you want to prepare something on your own), possibility of eating dinner (buy something at the hostel bar for 1200 HUF/3 EUR between 6 PM and 9 PM, and you will get a small but tasty dinner dish).

Also when we came the 1st night, when the toilet/bath was opened, it's clean, but then there was a foul smell. There is a stagnant water at the floor drain near the sink. Maybe that's the cause of the smell. 
Key cards was also not functioning for the entrance of the apartment and for our room. They gave us keys. They also tried to fix the door lock for days but was not succesful until we left. But it's totally fine. Maybe it should be placed in booking.com that the living room I'm the apartment is being shared for two rooms, so visitors would know and expect it. Also to also place that the visitors will do their own dishes after breakfast. Nothing wrong with doing the dishes after. But maybe, better to place at the hostels description online and/or be said while checking in.

If you spent a small amount at the hostel bar, you also got a free dinner. There was WiFi and a kitchen in the room, and my bed had curtains to allow more privacy. They have lockers for luggage, and if you don't have your own, you can buy a padlock from reception. The doors open with a key-card, for which you have to make a deposit of 5€, which you'll get back upon check-out. The location is perfect!

The hostel is SUPER international and you'll meet people from all over the world. So of you're up for this you'll love it.

Second time in a hostel in a year,"There are a lot of people, so there is always a lot of traffic, including in the evening and night hours. People who want to sleep may not have it easy.
Breakfast includes vegetables, an instant drink, milk (hot and cold) and cereals, bread and boiled eggs, jam, tea and coffee. However, there is no cheese or mortadella. Maybe something change from time to time so that it's not always the same, right?","This is my second time staying at this hostel. The price is adequate for the services offered. An obvious plus is breakfast included in the price of the stay (I recommend coming for a meal not right at 8:00, but a little later - it will be less crowded and more space).
If your check-in is in the evening, or you don't want to cook something yourself or go to the store, all you have to do is buy a drink in the hostel bar for 1200 HUF (about 3 euros) and you will get a hot meal for that price (on the photo an example of a Monday set).
Solo travelers will undoubtedly find plenty of opportunities to connect and socialize with other guests, both at the hostel and in the city.
Convenient location (metro, tram), only half an hour to the Danube on foot. 10-12 minutes to Nyugati train station.

"I really enjoyed it. Good ear plugs always help, in case the room faces a road or if neighbors snore","Towels are not provided but you have to either bring your own or buy one. Also, lockers without padlocks or key-doors is an interesting idea. So, again, you either bring your own padlocks or buy them. This is strange to have to pay extra for these basic things when people are trying to save money and travel light, I think. For example, at Klaipeda hostel all lockers had keys to them (logically) and 1 large towel was provided and changed upon request. Really great and thoughtful approach :)","Free breakfast that was included in the price. Nice option. Coffee, juice, toast with jam, bell peppers, cucumbers and tomatoes with boiled eggs, apples. They also offer dinner if you spend 3 euros at the bar. Different dish every night. Have not tried it myself, but looked and smelled good :)  The staff were very friendly and helpful, all of them! Every bed has a curtain around it which allows for privacy even in a room with 8 people you can have your own space. At the same time, one can also go to the public areas and meet lots of people. Really liked the possibility to leave the bags after check-out time until I had to leave. This is important. The location is great, it is approximately in the middle of Andrassy avenue, so about 30min walk to the Parliament in one direction or to the Heros' Square in the other. Also, any direction from the Oktogon Square is also worth going down. Beautiful architecture everywhere. Metro/subway station M1 yellow line is right at the square.

ONLY REVIEW YOU NEED. THANK ME LATER,"ANY MINUSES?
Yes there are, no free towels, that's with most hostels 

7 euro for laundry which they do for you. Bit steep. It's budapest and not Switzerland 😉

Detailed review to follow on youtube. Mark helpful if you found this review helpful 👍","So, this is the ONLY REVIEW you need to ever read

Everything that a hostel should have, this one does.
Good location (octagon square)

Great breakfast with eggs (free breakfast with no eggs is not even worth anything ever)
Also breakfast time is good 8.30 to 11. Checkout is 11 am too (unlike many other hostels with 10 am checkout and breakfast ending at 10 am too)

Best value for money honestly in off season it can be as low as 9 euros going up to 25 euros in peak season and weekends. 

Perfect mix of party hostel vs quiet hostel. Doesn't go to any one extreme. 

Great common room and kitchen . Free luggage storage

Volunteers are doing good job , I met Andres from Costa Rica and Michael from France. Very welcoming and also the blonde girl at check in 

5 euro charge as deposit which you get back 

Small details in dorm rooms :
Beds are already made unlike many other hostels where they give you sheets and you gotta make them. Small thing but when you arrived tired, it's good to see a ready bed.

small locker IN ADDITION to large ones (a first)

Curtains for privacy (Small thing but many hostels don't have it)

Hanging hooks 🪝 (small thing but you will be surprised how many hostels don't have it, sometimes even in bathrooms they don't)

Good mattress + enough height for each bed, bottom or top with high ceilings",9.0,April 2023,"April 26, 2023",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,1,Solo traveler,8.2

The breakfast buffet is fantastic, with plenty of fresh veg, fruit, bread, cereals and more (only lacking a plant based milk option ;) ).

Staff were friendly and very helpful. 
There’s plenty of locker storage per bed (bring a padlock) and they are also happy to let you store bags before/after checkout for a bit too!

Good value for money,"I was there on a weekend (Thu to Sun) and the hostel was obviously busy. 2 bathrooms per floor were not enough sometimes, but we could use toilets and showers on other floors.
Common area always pretty crowded, they don't have a large storage room so luggage was sometimes on the way.
Facilities are a bit old but functional.
Bit uncomfy mattress and pillows. 
No vegetarian option for dinner (at least from what I saw on the menu, but I didn't ask).
Drunk guests throwing up. Budapest is a party city and this is a problem everywhere in the centre (I lived here for over 7 months). I personally think hostels shouldn't offer drinking games nor alcohol until late, but I understand it's a good marketing strategy as it attracts people.","Spacious and large hostel, many rooms on 3 floors. Each floor has a kitchen, 2 bathrooms and 2 showers.
Great location close to grocery stores and tram stop.
Great welcoming staff. There was a problem with the bathroom and they solved it right away.
Good breakfast included in the price, possibility to have dinner at the hostel for free by getting a 3€ drink. Tho, I couldn't get dinner as there was no vegetarian option available.
2 PCs free to use on 3rd floor.
Great wifi connection on every floor and room, good if you need to get some work done.
Cleanliness ok. Could be improved, but the hostel was crowded so it was ok.
Free earplugs provided.
No bike racks, but you can lock your bike on the balcony in front of the reception.

"Excellent value, clean and great location.","Each pair of dormitories (14 beds in total) shares two shower / toilet rooms and because of the key card entry system, it isn't possible to use facilities on another floor if both are occupied.  I had to queue three times in two days and at one point (I always seem to be unlucky in sharing with people who take extended showers), I had to wait 40 minutes to use the toilet.  Although the bathrooms are within a key-card access area, they are outside the dormitory so you need to remember your key-card to use the loo, otherwise you'll be locked out of the dorm.
The bed wasn't very comfortable and there was no pillow protector.
On my second morning, the breakfast area was extremely busy and there was nowhere to sit.
Guests are asked for a deposit of €5 or Ft2000 on arrival.","The hostel is easy to find, located on the Oktogon, so well-connected to the rest of Pest and Buda, by tram or metro, with numerous shops, cafes, restaurants etc. in the immediate vicinity.  It's less than ten minutes' walk from Nyugati station and twenty minutes' from Keleti, whilst both Heroes Square (20 minutes' walk) and Vorosmarty Square (10 minutes) are easily accessible on foot via Andrassy Avenue.  
My first impression of the hostel wasn't good, with a long queue to check-in, but once I did, I was shown to my dormitory and given an explanation of how everything worked - the staff here are very friendly and helpful and the hostel is clean.  I liked the layout of the eight-bed dorm, with the beds back-to-back, so more like 2 4-bed dorms (but with very thin walls!).  Each bed has a privacy curtain, power point and reading light.  Although the main kitchen is downstairs (first floor - my dorm was on the second), each pair of dormitories shares a fully-equipped mini-kitchen (two ring hob, microwave and kettle) which should meet most needs and allows access to a kitchen at times when the main one is out of bounds (eg. when breakfast is being prepared).
Buffet breakfast is included and consists of bread (although there were queues for the toaster), jams, hard-boiled eggs, cucumber, tomato, peppers and cereals, available from 8-11am;  there is also a machine dispensing coffee or hot water for tea (again, there may be a queue).  The hostel also has a bar (spend €3 and get free food in the evening, served at 6pm - the menu changes daily) and offers a free walking tour daily at 3pm, on the first day after check-in.
Access to the building, reception and dormitories is by a single key-card and reception is open 24 hours.",8.0,March 2023,"April 7, 2023",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room with Standard Bunk Beds,2,Solo traveler,8.2

Lockers were really small and didn't have locks, however you could buy a lock from reception.
There was a key cash deposit of which I wasn't aware of before arrival, though they have an ATM at reception or a few across the street. In case you're used to card only payments.","Good location, next to tram stops & within walking distance of city centre, comfortable beds, big rooms, key access, bathroom in room, breakfast included (veggies, eggs, spices, bread, butter, jams, cereal, juice, tea, coffee), many international guests, spacious common area, nice staff.

The AC was a (big) fan  on the ground of the dorm room but only the people it was pointed at got any air. To be fair it was a pretty remarkably hot summer but you were pretty much sleeping in wet sheets drenched in sweat :(

Also, bring a lock with a thick metal thingy, the flimsy wire ones that extend don't work on these lockers.

The upper beds in the room for four was making more sound and movement than the ones in room for eight.","It is a great place, lots of people from everywhere and every kind and every age. 
The location is central and at an intersction point of trams, metro and busses. Theres a lot of restaurants, bistro, cafes and bars around. A spot for bike and scooter rent.
I stayed in two different rooms, one for 4 people with private bathroom and the other for 8 people with shared bathroom. I liked both actually, the room for eight people is devided in a way that every four beds have their own aisle, so it is like a room for four with shared entrance. The shared toilet was not crowded at all, I didnt wait even once for a shower or to use the toilet. It is overall clean, but a hygiene shower in the wc would be a great addition. The room for 4 has a great view outside on the octagon intersection with trams.
The rooms are very well sound-insulated from the public area, I didnt hear a sound from that side. But the street sound from the window was noisy. The trams are the most noise makers there. The beds are fairly comfortable and warm. There's a locker for luggage and small storage above the bed, a private socket and a lamp. Curtains on the beds offer some visual privacy.
The breakfast was very simple and basic; boiled eggs, vegetables, cornflakes, butter and jam, apples, tea and coffee.

When Cecei came to stay 🙋🏽‍♀️❤️,"My only neg was in the rooms (just the lowest priced) they don't have AC, so it gets a bit hot in there! 
This definitely sucks but that's my only fault.

Oh ..since it's in the middle of a city, it does get pretty loud. So if you need your beauty sleep, undisturbed, I'd suggest bringing earplugs! ❤️","So this is the second time I've stayed at Avenue. So here we go:
The staff are super friendly and helpful, they have a  24hr reception which is great, plus big lockers for storage space (both in the rooms, and out in the corridors)
The lovely staff show you to your room, right to your bed, which I think is super necessary, but not always done (just that little bit of extra care makes such a big difference). Super nice touch 

It feels really welcoming there 
They have bar crawls and parties advertised for every day of the week(!!)in the reception area, so you're sure to meet people if you're in search! (They're pretty awesome!) 
It's not a party hostel though, so you haven't got the same vibe as some others would be. However, the location is incredible! It's situated in the perfect place for travelling about!

Also the cleaners! 
You can see them floating around in a regular basis which is very reassuring, plus they have signs on the doors to encourage guests to report anything that needs attending to (""...we will sort it out ASAP"")

There are 2 kitchens to choose from if you want to cook; microwave, hob, kettle, big sink space (downstairs), a fridge on each floor, and plenty of clean utensils to use (plus washing up liquid, sponges and clothes to use!!)

There are computers to use, they recycle, they have a bar, you can ask just about anything and you'll be greeted with nothing but help and smiles!",8.0,July 2022,"July 29, 2022",Bed in 12-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,2,Solo traveler,8.2

Staff makes it worth it,"The hostel is in an old building and it could be cute if only it got a bit of renovation. Even though it's usually kept clean it still looks like it's going to fall apart soon. My worst fear was the bathroom - for the whole floor (4 rooms, around 20-30 people) there are two restrooms: 1 shower + pee, 1 shower + poo. One poo place for ~30 people.  The poo one is also super tiny and it's not comfortable to shower there, so it is more like one shower for ~30 people too. If you need to stay somewhere cheap and don't really care about anything - it's fine, but I've stayed in many different places and I just wouldn't come back here, at least before some renovations happen.","Staff - very nice, very helpful. Location is good - metro right outside, buses and trams, food, drinks, anything you want. There's free breakfast (cereal, tea, coffee, bread, jam, vegetables - it's basic but hey, it's free!) and the room was really big.

2. Unlike how it is shown in the pictures, not all dormitory rooms have curtains on the beds. It's only on the ground floor rooms. So, if at all you book a bed, try asking them for beds on the first floor, or if you ask, they will offer you extra sheets to cover the sides of your bed.","1. Breakfast was my favourite part. I would say that the breakfast (which was included in the bed charges itself would cost me more than what i paid for the bed. Full on value booking.

2. The receptionists were warm and kind. Especially, Oleh (Ukranian). He was always there whenever we needed something. 

3. The rooms were clean. 

4. In our 7 days of stay, we met people from 6 countries and made some good friends. 

5. The dining spot is big and comfortable. A good place to work during the rest of the day, or just have a chit chat.

6. Wifi is super fast. 

7. The surprise element is obviously the kitchen (includes a macro-oven, electric stove). You can cook anything you want, there are enough vessels, a kettle to make tea, all the plates, glasses and cups.

The Exceptional Avenue Hostel,"As nothing is perfect in life, well Avenue Hostel and most of the hostels I visited arround the world does not skip this philosophy.

All hostels must implement little bit of discipline, such as informing all guests with no exception: 

1- To not turn room lights after 11 when they enter the room, instead using the private light on their bed;
2- To not have phone calls inside the room as guests and travelers can be sleeping at any hour of the day;
3- To not keep the door open;
4- To not give remarks to other guests, and enter in silly confrontations, rather flag the issue to the staff at the reception to be delt with on a professional manner; and
4- To keep the voice down when they are talking in the lobby, taking into consideration that their voice can echo the whole floor.","Everything about this hostel was exceptional, and met my expectations as mentioned in the descriptions.

From the great location to thr inside house, where it was always clean, stylish, with excellent service. Food was good value for money and everyday room cleaning service was efficient.

The reception staff were very polite, caring, and helpful... 

The hostel animators (Sebastian) and the bartender (Andres) were both magnificent,  generous, smiley, with very strong communication skills, always full of energy, and made my stay and others guests time memorable.

While free, the breakfast is high in carbs with most items high in sugar. Eggs, cucumber / tomato would be the healthiest option.

Limited common space in the 'area' and in the reception.
Main kitchen by reception isn't for common use. The dining area is closed half of the day, so you'll want to go to a café etc.
Remember to get your deposit back for your room key!

"A decent option with a good location, but consider the cons before booking","According to the booking, the room was meant to have an AC, but it didn't. There was one fan for one room of 8 people so it was unbearably hot during both, the days and the nights. To try and cool of the room a bit, the window is left open basically 24/7 but since it faces the street there's so much noise of traffic and drunk locals / tourists which made it difficult to sleep and rest. Sometimes some staff seems a bit annoyed or uninterested in helping you, depends on who you interact with.","The location of the hostel is great -a lot of public transport connections and easy to find once arrived. Staff were mostly nice and accommodating. The beds, at least the ones in my room, had privacy curtains that were great for a hostel environment. They organize a lot of social activities too and try to get everyone involved. Also, it's great that it includes breakfast - boiled eggs, toast with spreads, tomatoes, cucumbers and cereal. It would be nice to rotate some extra options as that can get a bit repetitive depending how long you're staying there for, but overall it's filling and works well to start the day.",7.0,July 2023,"July 17, 2023",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,5,Solo traveler,8.2

more hostels should be like Avenue,"the entire building is poorly ventilated. it was more hot and humid inside than out. there is no smoking area, you have to go out to the street. there aren't enough luggage lockers in the building. i found one open cubby on a floor two levels down but it did not fit my combo lock (luckily i brought a tiny lock as well otherwise i would have had to buy a lock from reception). i swept the floor of the second room while settling in because i noticed it was dirty.","first night in a cheaper room had a locker big enough for luggage directly below the bed and an ensuite washroom–this was exactly what i was hoping for. each bed had a small cupboard, shelf, and electrical plugs.
the next two nights i was in a bigger more basic room that cost €12 more and didn't have a luggage locker, ensuite washroom, cupboard, or shelf adjacent to the bed. they said the room had recently been turned over from a private room.
shout outs to my fabulous roommates Lou and Maria for being such great companions, the karma trust we established with other roomies worked well (no theft), and thank you Ricardo and Sebastian for rallying the troops for a super night out with many people from the hostel. overall good vibes from other travelers, loved the food and unlimited espresso, bar service was great, and i sincerely appreciated the 24-hour check-in, thank you.",8.0,June 2023,"June 28, 2023",Bed in 6-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room with Standard Bunk Beds,2,Solo traveler,8.2

Great location  but lousy hostel mates,"We booked a private room but those who shared the common areas with us took the place as If it is their own and party right into the night and makes lot of noise. The walls are thin and not sound proof. It didn't help the the lights in the common room is automatic and keeps turning on whenever there is motion and doesn't even switch off after midnight and there's big frosted window in our room and it keeps lighting up as the curtains were not blackout.  The reception claimed we could inform them but there were no intercom and we had to go through the kids before going down. We fear for our safety and want no confrontation with them. They should provide a 24 hours watsapp service for us to inform the front desk of any issues.
Also the towels are worn off and not absorbent and I dun feel clean using it. The matteress are sunken and worn too. Not comfort. The pillows are mere pieces of broken sponges that are probably made from recycled kitchen sponges...very sad...",The Central location as it is a short tram and metro ride to everywhere and the hostel was great as it has common kitchen to make a hot drink and the occasional snack,7.0,May 2023,"May 27, 2023",Double or Twin Room with Private Bathroom,3,Couple,8.2

It was impossible to stay in the hall during evenings, because there always was loud music, you cannot hide from it on the second floor as well. andd one more- im allergic to dust, during the second night of staying my nose was itching as a hell, then i noticed that there was a ton of dust under my bed((((((","I absolutely love women who are working as a maids there!

"Good for a short stay (2 days max) and you might not sleep during the weekends, but the place is big","-The dorms are not that well designed, especially the 6-8-10 bed dorms. The beds are all attached in the same metallic structure and your sleep will depend on how other people behave when they sleep, which is a big russian roulette. Sleep is why people pay for a bed in the first place so it is kind of a problem when this can actually affect your sleep quality. 
-It is crowded all the time, even more on weekends. The popularity and cheap cost of the hostel bring everybody, and not the best people. I think the hostel should be more aware of people who lack politeness. Also it doesn't help that much to make contact with people since it looks more like a university residency according to the hugeness of the place.
-The AC doesn't really work so people complain in the dorm that it is too warm and then open the windows, which brings a lot of noise since we are near a big avenue. I personnally didn't care about AC, but this comes back to who come to the hostel and how people act when they are no consequences from the management. 
-The towel is not included and it cost 4 euros, which is really expensive since they keep it in the end. And it brings a lot of money if you look at how many people come to this hostel everyday.","-The place is big and clean
-The staff is helpful but some of them act a little bit rude (probably due to the constant rush of guests in the hotel)
-The breakfast is free (even if it is the exact same everyday though)
-The kitchen is big and well equiped to cook (important)
-Central location
-They do activities during the weekends at the hostel, if you are into this
-You can have a free dinner at the hostel if you buy 3 euros at the bar for a drink, which all in all is kind of a good deal. The quality of the meal vary everyday so it might not be your thing, but it is convenient",7.0,May 2023,"May 13, 2023",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,4,Solo traveler,8.2

Good,"people were talking in the room while others were sleeping. I think they should warn everybody before check-in.
When I first arrive there, I haven't had a reservation. they said that they don't have a fixed price so I had to pay 18 euros for the 8 bed room. but actually it was much more cheaper than that. I felt I was scammed.
After the first day, I said that I want to extend my stay. They say that they have to change my room because someone already booked mine.

overall it was a good stay,"the elevator to the hostel looks very sketchy but once you get inside the hostel premises, you feel more relaxed.
beds were metal ones which creaked with every turn you make which makes it uncomfortable sharing the space with people.
the room was also very cold at night. the heating just wasn’t enough. and although it’s great that there was a kitchen on the floor to make your own meals, the position of the kitchen made the whole floor smell of food which lingered in the air for hours.","the location is great. just a minute away from trams and centrally located.
they provide breakfast inclusive in the rate which is amazing even though it’s the same meal everyday i don’t think anyone can complain for the price. i really appreciated that.

A hostel that never sleeps,"❄ It could be a little bit cold in the room, and the blanket is thin.

☕ Awful coffee taste at the breakfast - much recommended a tea, it's wonderful!

💤 Unfortunately, not all respect the silence after 10 PM.

⚠ There is a cleaning staff, but still, some guests leave a mess and dirty after themselves.","🏨 Maybe, one of the most perfect localisation in Budapest: in nearby there are plenty of shops, cafeterias (McDonald's, Starbucks), bars, backery etc. The Oktogon metro station (line M1), bus and tram is almost in front of the entrance hostel's door. Only 10 min. by foot takes you to the railway station Nyugati.

🧭 It is not a very Budapest centre, but it is still not very far from the main destinations, where you would like to go.

🍽‍️ A simple breakfast that included in price (but enough for the beginning of your day) - is a very nice option. Additionally, if you buy something in the hostel's bar (from 6 till 8 PM) for the 3 euros, you can receive a plate with a supper (different meals for the different days).

🛌 A 12-person dorm is a large room, and the location of the beds and curtains allows for privacy. There are two lockers (bigger and another one, smaller, above your head on your bed). Socket and reading lamp above each bed.

🛎 Reception 24/7; plastic card as a entrance key both for main door and for you room. Print at reception what you need.

"great spot , clean , a bit loud","Breakfast is really simple. if you are vegan as I am, our choices are bread with olive and veggies.
 Also, our room was on the street side so be prepared for loud noises as trams and ambulances passing by all night non stop. If you close the window, i suppose youre gonna sleep pretty well. 
They dont offer towels and you either can buy from the hostel for 5 EUR and keep it or loan for 5 and they give you back 2 .
There are locker rooms without padlocks so they make you buy one off of them CASH ONLY for 3EUR . At least you get to keep the padlock.
Also, on your way in there is a fee of 5EUR when you get your key which they give you back when you check out and bring them the kea card back.
So if you come from a european country, make sure you have some extra cash with you for that kind of situations that nobody prepares you for.

"Cheap hostel with its pros and cons, free breakfast","The beds are awful, the whole construction shakes all the time when someone moves in their beds or even walks around the room. It's terrible, I woke up every time someone was climbing the ladder.
It's very hot in the room, there is a fan but it doesn't help at all. 
It can be very noisy and crowdy.
The bathroom and toilet doors have very old doors and it can be hard to lock them. 
Sometimes you have to wait to go to the bathroom, there can be queues. And the facilities need renovation.
But I can't complain, really, it's the cheapest hostel I've stayed in (and I've stayed in many many hostels) so I don't think you would be disappointed.

"Disappointed by the breakfast, but overall a good place to stay","Highly disappointed (except for the coffee machine) by the breakfast that was included in the price. It is quite limited: boiled eggs, + paprika, tomatoes, cucumber + apples + bread + 2 sorts of jam + cornflakes + some juice. No dairy, no fresh fruits (the freshness of apples is doubtful). Besides, it starts at 8am, which is quite late.
No bed curtains in my room, but I extended my stay and was allocated another room, where indeed there were individual bed curtains.
There are individual lockers in the room, but they are quite small and you have to bring your own lock. Some storage is also allowed in bigger lockers at the reception level, but the same principle (bring your lock) applies.
Didn't felt like a place where you can meet new people. Kind of cold atmosphere I would say.
3 times per week, there is a possibility of booking a simple dinner meal for 3 euros, that will be served in the hostel. I haven't booked it, but the portions looked quite small.","Well-located. Good stable Wifi in rooms and common parts. Good unlimited coffee during breakfast. Clean linen. 
On the floor, 2 quite clean common bathrooms for several rooms with (rough estimate) 15 people all together and one shared kitchen. The kitchen was clean, but the both fridges were overfilled with products in a doubtful state. I guess that here the cleanliness highly depends on the people living in the hostel.
I think the staff do some ""profiling"" by separating ""party people"" and more ""quiet people"" into different rooms: I was lucky enough to be assigned in the ambience where I want to be, so thanks to the staff.
There was some noise from the tram passing by, but I could sleep quite well.

Then we were told that our room is not ready and we didnt get access to our room. Personnel told us that the room will be ready in 5 min and we waited half an hour just to find out that it wont be ready soon. After half an  hour they told us that we can put our staff to the room anyway (which is only thing we needed - to put our luggage and go to the city but we had to wait 1 hour for them to letting us do it in still uncleaned room). There was some very bad smell from ventilation and opening of the window only made it worse.

It's okay,"The entrance to the hostel is not the best.
The location isn't great either. It's 30 minutes on foot from the centre, and also 30 minutes from the train station (Budapest-Keleti). For more or less the same price there are better-located hostels. Still, it's really close to the House of Terror museum. If you go to Budapest you should definitely go there!
There's free breakfast but I wasn't able to try it as it is only offered from 8 to 11, and I had to leave slightly before 8am to catch my train (this is not necessarily a con, but I wished I had known it before booking)
Finally, the area is not too loud, but I did have some trouble sleeping because of traffic and also because of some of my roomates who got back in the room at 2am and disrespectfully kept talking aloud and making a lot of noises.","I slept here only because I had to extend my stay in Budapest by a day, and I left very early in the morining, so I had no use for the services and facilities offered. It was one of the cheapest options and it was over all fine, though there are better hostels in the city. 
The room I was staying in (an 8-bed mixed dorm) had big lockers for each bed placed on the ground, as well as a smaller locker inside the bed. I think adding that smaller locker was a brilliant idea, especially for those sleeping in top bunks. Beware that you need to bring your own padlocks (I think there's the option to either rent them or buy them at the reception, but it's always better if you bring your own). There are also a handful of lockers in the hallway. 
The bathrooms and halls were all in all pretty clean. Conversely, the top of the locker in the bed was covered in dust. But really a lot. It could use some dusting every once in a while.",7.0,July 2022,"July 19, 2022",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,1,Solo traveler,8.2

They only offered juice, boiled eggs, one or two kinds of cereal, lukewarm milk (and not even with a lactose-free option), and untoasted bread with marmelade. I was honestly really disappointed that THAT was something I had uselessly paid for. Also the traffic noise from the street was awful, so earplugs were much needed when sleeping. Bring your own towel because sure, you can buy a towel at the reception for 2000 forint but it doesn't even qualify as a towel in material. It was more like a baby's soft blanket, pretty useless in drying yourself with. The cleanliness in my room was fine when I came, but they didn't change the common hand towel in the bathroom that everyone always kept using...

The toilet was always busy, the kitchen was so loud all the time we couldn’t sleep well, people was super load always at random times at night. I’m aware I paid for a room in a shared space but being a higher price for a room for 2 I’d expect to have similar people around us, sharing with a reasonable amount of individuals. It was way too many people. Also someone stole our lactose free milk from the fridge, not your fault but just not nice, again if there were less people sharing the same kitchen maybe that would’ve not happened.","The good vibes, the location, the bed was comfy, the breakfast was great, lots of options even fruit.

Nice atmosphere. But they should improve some things!,"1. The entrance to the building is unacceptable. You think you're entering a stable! 2. The breakfast is too poor (apart from the very nice coffee) They should add some more things. Otherwise, let them abolish it. 3. The space does not have air conditioning. Just a small fan. It's really hot and it's impossible to sleep in a shared space! Everyone had a problem. Whether they complained or not to the reception means nothing. And when I said it, nothing happened! 4. The independent rooms of 4, 6 or 8 people are too small. They also don't have good ventilation!
The owner should improve it a bit.. he has a lot of (young) customers.. he should respect and thank them a little more!
(I'm not posting the bad photos of the place that verify what I'm saying, and I believe that there will be at least some improvements that I'll see when I go again!

It was also insulting that the hostel management ignored my question about my early morning check out from the hostel. I asked about the possibility of getting breakfast in the morning, at least some yogurt and muesli, but I was not even offered that. And when I complained that they didn't specify the time for breakfast on the website and that I also paid for it, they only told me ""sorry"" and said that I can only make myself coffee in the morning.

I stayed in a 4-bed mix dorm, the room had ordinary lockers plus a little one attached to each bed. Night lamps and curtains around each bed were added touches of additional care towards the guests. The place was always very clean and tidy, the staff organised some activities at night and dinner was provided if you spent 4€ at the bar. Plus, after my check out, I could leave my bag in a locker for a few hours and this was very helpful to me.

Overall, a great experience at Avenue Hostel! It exceeded my expectations and I highly recommend it! Thank you to all the staff members: Maral, Erika, Kristofer and everybody! Sorry, I don't know all your names, but you were all very kind and you make a great staff altogether, thank you for your hard work and your smiles!

A Pleasure Avenue,What's not to love?,"Avenue is perfect for a stay in Pest. Many reasons why, but I'll mention the wonderful staff first & foremost. AMR, who works the nightshift, is an exceptionally kind & friendly character. He's from Alexandria, Egypt, but brought up in Oman, a favourite country of mine: if you plan to visit authentic Arabia, ask AMR: he's yer man. Of course, I had more conversation with him, but let me praise other great staff: Mateo, Maral & Oleg. Thank you, dudes, for such a welcoming stay. They were able to fulfil my request for a lower bunk, and even upgraded me for my last night to a bed in the quieter 3rd floor apartment for no extra charge. Wasn't expecting special treatment, but what's not to love?
Easy & central to get to, Oktogon being readily identifiable, got a metro station, but also simply walkable from both Keleti & Nyugati train stations. 100E airport bus drops at Deak Ter, from where it's just a stroll up Andrassy boulevard past the opera. Which brings me to a key benefit: fear not if your flight gets in late, because reception's open for check-in 24/7, so no panic (just makes civil sense to advise them likely time of arrival).
Facilities are not mega (e.g. no pool table, clothes drying area, so if you've been to one of the many baths it may take a while for your towel to dry) but there are well-equipped kitchens on each floor, big breakfast (decent free buffet spread) which doubles as a bar later on, with big sports screens: a good place for meeting folk. It's a hostel with wide appeal with diverse nationalities & ages. The dorms are fairly standard, comfy enough, sufficient space. Toilets & showers just round the corner, and they seemed pretty well maintained, given that the hostel was naturally busy when I was there June/July.
And another significant thing: superb value for money, super-affordable for a well-run, safe, clean, comfortable central hostel in one of Europe's must-see cities.",10,July 2024,"July 13, 2024",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room with Standard Bunk Beds,1,Solo traveler,8.2

The whole hostel was really clean, the room was spacious, there's even enough space to store multiple luggages next to and under the bed without disturbing anyone.

It was a little colder in the room, they were blasting the AC, I was a bit worried about this but I didn't catch a cold (and trust me, that happens very easily for me) so you'll be fine too probably.

Access to the building and rooms are with key cards.

ATM and soft drink vending machine is available on the first floor. We can use the kitchen and its utensils to cook our meals.

The free breakfast provided is  basic but healthy and satisfying: milk, boiled eggs, cereals, bread, butter, three types of marmelaide, cucumber and tomatoes all you can eat. Plus coffee and two types of tea - black tea and fruit tea. Similary, spend Euros 4 on drinks, and we get a free simple but satisfying meal in the evening.

What made Avenue Hostel special is its treatment to guests. I accidentally made 2 reservations - one direct on its website, and another one with booking.com. By rules since I didn't cancel any, I need to pay both. The front office staff, Ms. Petra, was kind enough to consult with her manager on the phone, and made a fair arrangements such that I only need to add the price difference between the two platforms for the first night.

One day after I checked out, its finance department made a mistake by charging my credit card. After I returned to my country, I wrote requesting Avenue Hostel to take a look to this case. Mr. Oleh Podolyan, its Front Office Manager, replied to my message. Three days later I received the refund.",10,April 2024,"April 21, 2024",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room with Private Bathroom,3,Solo traveler,8.2

ROOM WINDOWS OPEN WITH 4 DEGREES,"ChatGPT Judge issues the following verdict:

As a judge, it's essential to consider both sides of the argument. While fresh air is indeed important for occupants' health, the risk of exposing guests to cold temperatures all night, potentially leading to hypothermia, is a serious concern, especially when the building has central heating available. 

The hostel should ensure a comfortable and safe environment for its guests, which includes maintaining appropriate room temperatures. However, there should also be a balance between ventilation and thermal comfort. 

In this case, the hostel should find a solution that addresses both concerns, such as adjusting the heating system to allow for ventilation while maintaining a comfortable temperature or providing alternative methods for ventilation without compromising guests' safety and comfort. Failure to address this issue adequately could indeed be considered a violation of travel sustainable standards. 

Therefore, the verdict would likely require the hostel to take necessary measures to ensure that guests are not exposed to excessively cold temperatures while also maintaining adequate ventilation within the rooms.","Guest complains room window open all night with 0 to 9 degrees celsius,  unpleasant and risk of hypothermia, violation of travel sustainable standards since building has central heating

"Excellent value, fun, people, breakfast and bar... I'd go back anytime","Dinner was free with a 4 euro drink at the bar, and was just ok tasting and a rather small portion (but to be fair, it was very affordable and unexpected). I would recommend going for dinner at one of the local kebab shops where you can get a full meal size for around 4 euro. The dinner is very much ""student food"", and to be fair I've not be a student for a long time and so eat quite a bit different normally. I very much recommend the free breakfast though. Also, if you do not buy a drink with a free dinner token (as in you just buy the drink) the drink costs half as much. So the bar is very good value.","Breakfast was excellent (and included with the accommodation). Free ear plugs were also offered and very much appreciated. The beds are more like pods because you either have curtains closing your bed off to the rest of the room, or you have an actual pod, which just has a small opening to the room (and you can get a free sheet to cover this opening if you prefer to be totally enclosed). It made for a much more pleasant night's sleep than a hostel normally would be for me. There are mostly secure storage units in/next to each of the pods, which you will need a pad lock for (you can rent one cheaply from the desk or bring one- I don't know how much they cost as I had one on me). Every night at the hostel they do some sort of activity with the guests, which helps you meet new people. They also have a social group WhatsApp, so that you can easy interact with the others guests that are there during your stay. I'm on the older side, so wasn't really trying to get involved in a lot of that, but I thought it was really lovely and it did help when I had questions (as I was able to ask them in the WhatsApp group and get responses right away without having to go down to the front desk). There were also a few other older people around the place that seemed to also be enjoying themselves, so this place is great for older and younger people alike. The bathrooms are very clean. They also will send someone up immediately if they ever need to be cleaned right away (they have multiple signs posted telling you this, but from what I saw they kept up on the cleaning very frequently so I never needed to reach out). The whole place is very clean. I'm returning there again at the end of my holiday, and will be very happy to stay there after that as well from time to time as I pass through Budapest. I've even asked my husband if he'll stay there with me when we pass through together, because I feel like this place is just such good value and is a bit fun!",10,February 2024,"February 23, 2024",Bed in 6-Bed Mixed Capsule-Style Dormitory Room,1,Solo traveler,8.2

A bargain for what it offers you.,"The entrance is a bit strange. The bathrooms could be biger. But guys, notice that I’m just trying to find something to complain. Overall, the experiencie worths a lot.

Keep in mind, of course, that this is a hostel. So you kinda have to deal with some lack of privace, and stuff like that.","It’s basically a bargain, but also, all the staff are really, really friendly, specialy Szabi and Vyon.

Also, it is placed in a WONDERFUL location, close to Oktogon (an important  intesection of the City) , like 1 minute or less from the station in wich pass the main line of the City, for the tourists (line 1).

If you want (and I defnilly recomend) you can easily walk to the main atractions, in a mater of minuts (3 or 4 to Ópera, like 15 to the shoes and chain bridge, 20 to the Parlment).

The guys serve some drinks and stuff on the bar ( I recomend the hot chocolate, 2 euros) and there’s a promo in wich you expend 5 euros on something, and gain a free a meal.

There is a breakfest, simple, of course, but with bread, stuff to put on it, eggs, some vegetables, cereal and even a coffe machine. 

We also made a guided tour with a guy that works on the hostel, Sebastian. Got to say it was one of the best guided tours i’ve ever had, and i’ve been to a lot. It is free, but of course, it is recomendable to contribute with something, since the guy provides you a service, btw very well.

About the accomodations, one thing that I loved is that the beds got courtains. Also, altough the place in the entrance and main hall might be a bit louding, the doors of rooms kinda have an isolation, so it is quiet to sleep (as long as youre room mates are not loudy, lol).

They got one bathroom for each floor, with 3 showers (private).

They let us store our luggage atill the night, on the day we left it.

Fantastic,The entrance hall that you go through to get to the actual hostel gives abandoned house vibes but it really just hides a gem of place! Also heard from the staff that they're working on renovating the entrance hall.,"The hostel exceeded all my expectations! The daily free breakfast buffet was impressive: there was bread you could toast, jam, butter, boiled eggs; cut cucumbers, tomatoes and paprika; cornflakes as well as milk and fruit. The dinner they offer is fine too: you get it for free by spending at least 3 euros on drinks at the bar. Great option if you don't feel like cooking! The whole hostel (excluding the initial entrance hall) is decorated and furnished well, the staff is dedicated and helpful. They also offer a free walking tour of the highlights of the city which I highly recommend - Sebastian is a great guide! The hostel also organises activities throughout the week which is a nice way to meet people, especially when you're travelling alone. 
The bathrooms and toilets were clean and looked very nice. I had an upper bed, the bed linen was clean and you don't need to pay extra for it.

Very cool option to have free dinner, if you buy a drink, breakfast is okay too. I'm not sure why people complain about free BF. Their coffee is amazing, can't believe it's free. 
Hosts Mateo and Jenni were very nice professionals, they help with everything you ask for. If you have a question or need help, please ask!! 
They let you store luggage before and after your stay for free unlike other hostels. 
It is hard to locate in the beginning but it has very convenient location, just look for Starbucks sign. 
They ask you to put a 5 euro deposit, which you'll get back once you return the key. It is a regular practice in Canada so I was not surprised at that.

absolutely brilliant little stay in central budapest.  we wish we could have stayed for longer.,"We didn't have many negative things to say about the hostel as it was much better than we could have imagined.

You must bring a padlock for your storage locker as it isn't provided - and you need to bring a five euro note for your room key deposit.","This hostel was extremely good value for money.  We booked three beds and the room was more like a capsule hotel than a hostel.

The bed was a little hard, but there was an individual reading light and two storage boxes (one built into the capsule) and one large one which would easily fit a large rucksack beside the bed - which also doubled as a bench.

The room was mostly quiet - unfortunately we had a few young girls in the room who came in and out at 4am in the morning and played music whilst others were sleeping - until we asked them to turn it off.

The hostel has a no tolerance policy which is good - so everyone gets a good night's sleep.

The room had a keycard system and everyone in the party gets a key - you need to bring 5 euros for the deposit (even though this isn't Hungary's official currency) and you get it back so long as you don't lose the card!

The showers and bathrooms are clean and the staff are always cleaning them.

The breakfast buffet is great for a hotel and there were hot and cold choices.  Breakfast is from 8am-11am and the tables and breakfast room is always clean.   You can eat as much or as little as you want and hot tea and coffee (as well as hot chocolate) are also available.

The location is great! It is within walking distance of everything.   We actually walked to the thermal spa and to the city centre for our walking tour - as well as to and from the airport bus stop.

There is also a metro station right beside the hotel as well as a tram stop.

Supermarkets are also within a very very short walking distance - and the 'house of terror' museum is only 2 minutes walk away too.",10,February 2023,"March 3, 2023",3 Beds in 12-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,3,Family,8.2

The breakfast was amazing (juice, coffee, tea, jams, cereals), everything you need to start fully your day.
Common kitchen and room with one of the best views.🖼

Everything's near, metro, bus, stores etc.
I really enjoyed it that I went to another hostel and we asked if it's possible to go again for the breakfast and maybe pay and eventually we stayed there one more time. They have board games and a stand with activities offers.

I really appreciate the fact that they were really welcoming and they let us keep our staff there before and after check out. For example we had to leave around 11, but we wanted to go to shop some last things before our plane and the kept our stuff without a problem, so we could go calm for the last day. SAME when we arrived, we left from our previous hostel at 10, but the check in in Avenue was at 2, so we've been told to drop our stuff there and come back once the check in was available.

Amazing staffs!,,"Not the first time I stayed in this hostel, and certainly not the last! 
There are some new faces this time among the staffs, reception and the housekeepers. They are all super friendly, knowledgeable and professional; all your problems get done efficiently!
Special thanks to the housekeeper, Sebestyén. He really is hard working and pays attention to the details everytime when cleaning no matter how dirty it will get in the next couple of hours. 
Thank you all for making the hostel and Budapest a better place:)",10,August 2021,"August 30, 2021",Bed in 12-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,29,Solo traveler,8.2

WRONGLY checked in and someone in my bed!,"I was WRONGLY checked in in someone's else bed (we had similar name).I did a normal check in in the afternoon and later in the night I left to go to the city. When I came back at 4h30 morning I HAD A GUY SLEEPING in my bed. All my stuff that were in the bad were put in a plastic bag at the reception. Receptionist told me to go up and pick up my luggage and go to another room at 5h00... Terrible mistake and experience. No compensation given by the hostel, only a ""sorry we made a mistake""... 
I'm changing my evaluation score as the only answer from customer service was a ""sorry, we're human beings"". That's why we give our identity during check-in, so you can READ our names. It was a disaster to arrive 4h30, get scared by someone in my bad and discover that all my stuff were in a plastic bag in the reception (underwear, pyjamas). I paid 166€ for 3 nights, the least we expect is to be able to sleep peacifully.","Good location, good breakfast and bar!

"Great place if you want a cheap place to sleep, but not to stay all day in hostel.",It was very hot and humid during nights - unfortunately 8 people in the same communal bedroom was too much. The breakfasts were also somewhat boring and there was not much choice.,"The location was good, close to the trams and underground stations. The breakfasts were also quite OK, and the staff was ready to help at all times. Also there are a lot of events that are happening almost every evening.",5.0,May 2024,"July 24, 2024",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,4,Group,8.2
Very good breakfast and reception but the dorm rooms were boiling.,The rooms had no air conditioning / was not working and was boiling hot inside and 1 fan between 8 people in dorm.

"It was worth, but I wouldn’t recommend it.","The gusts itself wasn’t kind as well, even though there’s plenty of requests (from hostel staff) to keep the silence and be quite after 10pm, it was very loud and lots of guests was coming in super noisy at 2am/4am into the room witch I can’t blame the hostel, as it is expected to people to have comum sense. 
The reception and kitchen staff was very kind and helpful, besides the awkward situation on my check-in when they requested me to pay a deposit for the key (witch was fine for me) the awkwardness is that the fee is 5€, and when I gave the guy a 20€ he asked me to keep it, and when I said no, I want my change he in fact have the change witch make me wonder why would him ask to keep the 20€ when he had there the change. 
The cleaning stuff made me fell real uncomfortable one morning when I came into the bathroom and as I saw them there asked if i could use the toilet or not and they said “yes you can” and them when I was getting ready for the day they was doing angry noises around me and in a very rude way asked to leave the place, I do understand they’re doing their job to clean, and it would be okay if they had said me first thing to use another toilet as they would start the cleaning process in that one, but no, they said I could use and then just kicked me out when they wanted and I had to move to another toilet for finishing getting ready.","The location was amazing, you can get anywhere from the hostel, there’s bus and metro almost at the door. 
It was surprisingly clean and the beds are comfortable enough. 

The one huge minus on the hostel is also the huge plus, because of it’s location it can be real loud, it was a lot of ambulances and police cars going around really noisy in some late hours witch might disturb those of light sleep.",6.0,June 2024,"July 14, 2024",Bed in 12-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,4,Solo traveler,8.2
