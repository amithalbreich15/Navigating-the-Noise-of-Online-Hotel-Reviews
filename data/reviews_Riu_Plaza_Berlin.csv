A very nice and pleasant stay for our family,Reception personal was rude. I do not understand why. They are in most places very nice and polite but not here.,"We had junior suite for 2+2 person which were perfect. Two bathroom two tv. Very good beds. Two shower and separate bathtube. Very good connections everywhere. Very goog sound proofing. Nice view. One of the biggest free parking house ever seen, 13 floors atleast.",10,July 2024,"July 7, 2024",Superior Suite,1,Family,8.3
Fully satisfactory and a great value for the money. Will stay here again,"Getting from the parking house to the hotel was a bit complicated. Also it was a bit difficult to understand on the website, how the free parking worked.","The location is really fine - close to KDW and Wittenbergplatz Station but without the noise and busyness of the Ku'Dam. Walking distance to the very nice and charming neightborhood of Nollendorf. The free parking really is a great saving, when you arrive by car. The rooms were a good size.",8.0,July 2024,"August 21, 2024",Deluxe Double Room,3,Couple,8.3

"Good location, but rather a design hotel than a comfortable one.","Design over functionality of the rooms. We struggled finding the plugs, the bathroom was without doors and with a transparent wall, it is ok for couples but it is odd for a group of friends not to have any privacy.

Was pleasent,Certain staff in the day shift. When we checked in we requested a late check out for which the night shift told us to check with the morning shift staff.

"Great value, met all of my needs.","My room was arctic cold, the controls had zero effect, and the duvets were summer weight. But the big negative is the ongoing building work,  I was offered a first room with scaffolding outside of my 12th floor window, but was then changed to a room, without  a view of the building work.

For people arriving by car don't forget to get a Umweltplakette Deutschland - an environmental badge that denotes the emissions of your car.  Without this pass you can get a 100 euro fine and sent out of the city centre.  We picked ours up at a TUV (basically the German MOT station) at a small town Rheine en-route, 6 euros, and you do need your V5C logbook..","Excellent access ariving by car, with a multi-storey garage with ample parking.  The room itself was ideal, in that it had a combination of tiles and wooden floors, a hugh bed and wow views of the city.  Breakfast was remarkable, both from the extensive offering and I would say value for money.  Nearby are some wonderful eclectic neighboughoods, such as the Winterfeldtplatz, off the main tourist locale, but in my opinion better value, and a truly great vibe.",8.0,July 2024,"July 16, 2024",Deluxe Double Room,3,Couple,8.3

"Great stay overall, with a minor refreshments issue.","Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the tea and coffee offerings in the room itself. This morning, I went to make a cup of tea and discovered that one of the coffee creamer pods was pierced, so I could only use the other pod available. Unfortunately, this pod appears to have been off, as it curdled when added to the hot tea already in the cup. The room had a fridge, which was turned off. Personally, I don't understand why milk for the tea can't be kept in the fridge (coffee creamer is not an ideal accompaniment for tea, in my personal opinion). Just something to consider if you're planning a longer stay and you enjoy drinking tea in the English way.","The deluxe room we stayed in was a lovely size, well decorated, and the ensuite bathroom was a fair size and well stocked with towels and pillows. The room has a small safe, ideal for keeping your important personal possessions while you are out for the day. There is a kettle and cups in the room, along with tea, coffee, and sugar. There is also a bottle of complimentary sparkling water available for guests.

The hotel is in an excellent location, only a few blocks away from the popular KaDeWe and the rest of the Ku'damm shopping precinct. The hotel is located a short walk away from the U-Bahn station Wittenbergplatz, which will make accessing the rest of Berlin fairly simple during your stay at the Riu Plaza Berlin. The hotel also offers parking to its guests, for those guests arriving by car.

We enjoyed a drink in the bar on the ground floor, which has an interesting drinks menu. We chose not to have breakfast at the hotel, but there is a restaurant at the hotel for those guests who opt for their breakfast service.",8.0,July 2024,"July 2, 2024",Deluxe Double Room,1,Couple,8.3

"Overall, our stay in Berlin was great, thanks in part to the Riu Plaza Hotel! Thank you.","However, the room surprisingly features a shower with transparent glass doors. This might be a lovely idea for a romantic couple, but my daughters are a bit more self-conscious, so I think this was a drawback during our stay. I believe the hotel designers could have thought this through a bit more.","The Riu Plaza Hotel is a true giant near the Berlin Zoo.

For my stay with my two daughters, I was looking for a hotel that offered good parking options and proximity to the Zoo and Aquarium. This hotel perfectly meets both criteria.

Granted, the accommodation isn't exactly the cheapest. You can likely find cheaper options in the area. However, the price at Riu Plaza includes parking, which other hotels charge extra for, and there's no uncertainty about finding a parking spot.

Upon arrival, we surprised the receptionist, as he couldn't find our Booking.com reservation for a while. Eventually, we got access to a very nice and clean room. 

Overall, we were pleased with the excellent breakfast. Although it's quite busy due to the number of guests, and you might have to wait in a short line to enter the dining area, the food selection was phenomenal and very tasty. So, top marks from me!

Thank you, I look forward to returning and will gladly recommend it!",9.0,May 2024,"June 15, 2024",Deluxe Superior Double Room,2,Family,8.3

Excellent the next time we are in Berlin. We will make sure to stay with you.,"The breakfast was a little pricey at 25 euros, particularly if you don't eat much.  Maybe 20.  Also, I recommend having take away for guests who aren't ready to come down yet.    Accommodation for those who only want coffee and a roll would be nice.","Breakfast was excellent!

Good stay - but the cleanliness of the beds needs to be addressed at the Hotel,"I had booked a twin bed room but when we arrived we were given a standard room, my booking through Booking.com clearly stated twin bed room.  
The hotel is having some work carried out and has scaffolding around part of the Hotel, our room was affected by this and it obstructed the view from our room, it would have nice to be informed of this or be assigned a different room.
On our last day my Uncle stripped the beds and we found that the mattress protectors were urine stained and that the mattress itself was also urine stained. The bed sheet was clean though.
This was not what I expected from this Hotel, both myself and my Uncle were quite upset to see this.
I would suggest that you check the beds thoroughly before you accept any room.","The hotel location is great being close to the Wittenberg U-Bahn and also further along the road the Kaiser Wilhelm bombed out church which is well worth a visit. Across from the U-Bahn is also the Ka-De-We which is a well known high end store. Just outside the Ka-De-We are the stops for the hop[-on hop-off buses. There are two of these services one is Red and the other is the Yellow buses, we used the Yellow one which was good and took you around the main sights. I would suggest that you do some research into the other one though and see where that goes. 
I travelled with my Uncle and by the time we got to the Hotel we were both very tired, the Hotel has an excellent breakfast service although we tried to get something in the evening and were told that they don't do food in the evening.
So you need to plan ahead for evening meals and go out, it's Ok if you like fast food but you need to search around if you want a better quality meal.",8.0,April 2024,"April 22, 2024",Deluxe Twin Room,4,Couple,8.3

Comfortable hotel in the west side of Berlin,"There is a small fridge in the room that barely kept things ""fresh"", not cold enough.

First they didn't let us in the restaurant. They said they have no space, while half of it was empty. Then they let us in and took our order after 25 minutes from a menu that only has 6 options. I ordered a margarita pizza and a Caeser salad and 2 beers. I never seen any burned Margarita pizza with bacon, Rucola and tomato paste; and also sands in the Caeser salad!! unbelievable!!

Our room was exceptionally clean, and every morning when we came back from breakfast, the room had already been cleaned again. The Reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  The Bar staff were also helpful, in particular one lady called Regina, who went above and beyond her duty in serving up food and drinks when we returned from our walks around the city, at times when the bar was just about to close. The staff here seem intent on making sure their visitors have a good experience, very refreshing. The location is very convenient, just a short walk to the Ku'dam shopping area and good transport links to the city centre.",9.0,June 2022,"June 17, 2022",Deluxe Twin Room,3,Family,8.3

Huge and clean badroom with a open bath room,"There is no door between room and bathroom. At the night when you turn on the light of the bathroom, the light will light up the whole room. It is quiet disttubing. I am glad there is a seperate toilet, so you dont need to turn on the light of the bath room when using the toilet. In the shower there was no hook for the towel. I hate that when I can hang up my cloths and towel on inside of the door. 
Most annoying was the connection between the hotel and share parking garage. You have to drive 8 floors with narrow slopes before you reach the parking lots of the hotel. And then you have to take the stairs (the lift is very slow) to the 12th floor. And then you have go through 8 doors (!!!!) and three stairs before you reach your hotel room. If you have large luggage, it will takes half hour to reach your room. I think the parking is free for a reason.",The hotel is on walking distance to conference facilities and shopping district Bikini. Our room was huge. I think 35m2. We have chosen for Riu Plaza because of free parking. But the other facilites are better than expected too. The hotel has a extended breakfast buffet with a lot of choices.

RIU is a good hotel to stay in. It is close to transport and in a vibey part of Berlin.,"The Hotel seems to be a bit rigid on arbitrary things in my opinion. They do not provide teas and coffees in the rooms instead offering it at the reception and you have to come down to fetch it which seems a bit tight to me for a Hotel of this magnitude. They also provide 1 complimentary sparkling water in the room but cannot under any circumstances swap this out for still water without charging you. This seems extremely petty and trivial and greedy from their side and to squeeze money out of an already paying guest. 

They also could not give us a room with 1 bed even when I specified it when making the booking. I was explicitly told that that is a wish and not ever guaranteed so the best they could do was 2 single beds closer to each other. I then had to push the bed's together and this is the first time a Hotel ever told me this. And I expect a better quality of service from a hotel of this size and rating.","The room at the hotel was large and stylish. Modern finishing as well and a nicely spaced bathroom. It had central air conditioning done well and underfloor heating which was underwhelming but a nice touch anyway.

The staff at the hotel were friendly and accommodating which I appreciate after being in Paris. German hospitality get full marks there. 

The breakfast at the hotel is 10/10. There is a large selection of foods to cater for alot of people and the breakfast area is fairly large to accommodate alot of people. 

Location is very close to the Wattenburgplatz metro station and close to alot of restaurants and vibey places so it makes it very easy to get around town",8.0,May 2022,"May 4, 2022",Deluxe Double Room,3,Couple,8.3

Good location,"The people (at the reception) not super friendly and helpful, client-orientated, the precise description.
The room we stayed is not ok for 3 persons, as the bathroom does not have a DOOR.
No bathrobes provided. 
Could not use shower gel or shampoo. I was saved as I  have my own.
People at a a bar in the evening could not make a ' smile"", no way:).
During our stay l had my birthday but no extra +. However, I heard that the lady whose name is Despina (in charge of a welcome desk of the canteen for a breakfast) congratulating people for their BD. My German is not ideal, but still to that level.

As for 4* hotel a bit - still to try to be 4* hotel.

If you are 3 adults, you need  2  really separate rooms. 

The breakfast was good and a choice fits everyone tastes and preferences.

With a SUV to reach 12th  floor is a bit of a challenge, if you park a lower floor, you would need to bring your suitcases yourselves, unless it is only  a backpack.
If you come late, like our case, no space. But difficult to judge, you have to see for yourself - until you arrive to the 12th floor, from which you have to take an elevator that goes to a reception (no other option).
If no space - you go down and park at a lower floor. But still an  elevator from the 12 th floor.
In general, lots of people working at the hotel speaking all different languages not only DE or EN. Respect!
That is why I love Berlin!!!!!","The location is nice, can still walk or take  a public transportation, which is nearby.

Enjoy your staying in this hotel anytime,"I would like to have a good information about the services of the hotel, especially the accuracy for it. In fact, there is a big issue that I would like to share with you. It is about the fact that the check-out is 11h00 AM, instead of 12h00 AM. I checked many times this issue and inside the intranet of the RIU hotel website is indicated clearly that the check-out is 12h00 AM. But, the reception in Berlin has another check-out, I mean 11h00 AM. It is a really issue and I would like to solve this problem now, as I avoided 15 bookings for this hotel in the last 2 years. It is not normal to have indicated on the booking.com website that the check-out is 12h00 AM and at the RIU hotel reception the check-out is 11h00 AM. It is a real confusion and this must be solved, as many guests will not be gladly with this information. I was not glad when I found this situation and I had to ask about it at the reception. Two ladies of the staff reception were almost rude, saying that it is not true about this check-out time, I mean 12h00 AM and I must show them the proof. But the correct information on booking.com website and RIU intranet website says clearly that check-out is 12h00 AM. I hope booking.com Customer Service will inform RIU management hotel and solve quickly this issue, in order to let guests to know the real and good information. Many 4 stars standards hotels usually have 12h00 AM as the check-out time, that means RIU Plaza Berlin can have the same check-out. It will make guests to choose this hotel more, if the check-out is 12h00 AM, instead of 11h00 AM.","Some words for this question: the room was ok, the location is perfect and the design is great.

Cleaning stuff very overzealous to clean rooms. Knocking early in the morning (9am) to ask if the room needs cleaning. One time i came back from breakfast only to find my room was being cleaned (just before 9am again), meanwhile I needed to get changed and go to a conference - very annoying! I started to hang the do not disturb sign all the time until i left for the day, but this is the first time I've ever needed to use it in this way. My advice is, never begin cleaning a room if a guest is checked in, during the breakfast service, and don't knock on doors and enter while the guest is literally still in the room (in the morning, i can understand if it's after lunch and the guest is still in the room, you need to know if the room still should be cleaned). These are very basic operating procedures at any hotel, I'm not sure if it's universally different in Germany or if there's no such procedures at this hotel in particular.
Power points not in very convenient locations, you should at least provide an extension cord to the table from the side.
The wifi seemed to only be limited to one device registration. This is really poor because most especially business travellers will have a laptop as well as phone.

Not a massive problem, or even a complaint - more just about needing that little attention to detail if they offer these kind of services.","The room size was really good.

Below average,For almost €200 a night this room is way to expensive. The shower is dangerously extreme slippery. When the toilet is flushed you get burned under the shower.

Fair,"Year after year, we've graced Berlin with our presence for the ITB Berlin fair, faithfully booking our stay at the RIU Plaza, a decision we're beginning to question. This year, it seems they've decided to embrace the Ice Age, with room temperatures steadfastly refusing to breach the 25-degree mark - a fact that would've been appreciated had we been penguins. Even it was not 25 degree .The breakfast setup, requiring daily tributes rather than a one-off payment, felt less like a hospitality gesture and more like a test of endurance. To top it off, my room came with a complimentary scaffold view, ensuring that any attempt at showering was potentially a public spectacle. So, to the future guests considering a stay, unless you're in the market for a frostbite with a side of exhibitionism, you might want to look elsewhere.

It was not the hotel that I was expecting specially with the price that we paid for for our room. We were very disappoin,"- Very noisy room since it was besides a cleaning staff room and 3-4 people were sitting there with the door open. I haven’t Seen anything like that in the past. Also, when I asked The reception about the issue, what they told me was that we only have this room available. All the rooms are fully booked. This was not a convincing excuse because I have booked a hotel in in advance.
The second issue was the parking place for my car which was only available in the 12th floor and getting there was a nightmare with very tight corners and it was very difficult to drive a car 12 floors up and down. ￼ I just left my car during the entire trip in the parking garage.

"Insulting, Upsetting, Horrible Staff Experience","On our first night, we looked to dine in the restaurant which had only 2 other tables in use. We were sat with our 1 year old beside another table in use, in spite of the large area which could have accommodated us elsewhere for comfort with the child.

Our baby was in a very playful mood and was in his high chair playing with his toys and making the usual noises out of a baby. We were left waiting 15 minutes and still nobody had taken our order, which was a little annoying as the baby was getting quite hungry.

It was at this point that our entire stay and visit to Berlin turned sour. We were approached by a staff member who stated ""This might sound rude, but can you please stop the baby from making noise, as we have other guests"".

As one could imagine, this was hugely upsetting. This effectively told us we were not welcome, and we promptly left the restaurant bringing just a plate of potatoes up to the room with us, to try and feed the baby. Potatoes which I should add, were not nice at all.

We left and fed the child. We then had to put him back in his buggy, now past his bedtime, and bring him back outside the hotel to try and find somewhere for my wife and I to eat. This had a spiralling impact on the baby's bedtime etc.

We noted this experience to the reception staff as we left the hotel again to find somewhere to eat. The staff member we spoke to was shocked at what we were saying, and reiterated that this shouldn't happen and that he'd pass on the details of our experience. Unfortunately no more was done from here on. No management apology, no compensation, nothing.

We had to find elsewhere for breakfast the following morning as we felt we were not welcome in the restaurant. Another issue with a baby as they want to eat immediately in the morning.

There was such a sour taste left in our mouths after this, and we are worried about another stay in a RIU hotel which we have booked for June.","The reception staff were great and the lobby and in particular the room were fantastic; really clean, spacious and beautiful design.",6.0,February 2024,"February 15, 2024",Deluxe Superior Double Room,2,Family,8.3
"Decently located hotel that serves a nice, fresh breakfast. Beds could be a bit more comfy, though.","We found the bed to be very uncomfortable. The mattress was old and worn out, with spots that sunk badly. Plus, the bed frame creaked under the slightest movement. Similarly, the pillows weren't supportive enough and it's a shame to only have 1 small pillow for each person.
We've had simillar experiences in cheaper hotels before, so this wasn't a complete surprise, but we did expect slightly better from a hotel of this price/caliber. Still, the responsibility is ours, not the hotels, because we chose not to complain and ask for a room change. We decided that it wasn't worth the hassle, but I'm sure the staff would have helped us if we had mentioned anything, they were helpful in every other regard.","As most reviews have noted, the breakfast is nice.

The water in the shower while showering sometimes became too hot without turning it hotter.
There were free coffee, tea, coffee cream, and sugar in the lobby. Obviously, no one uses it because the coffee cream was spoiled and the hotel staff do not watch after that.
On the first night after arriving in the room someone opened the door to our room but before the person came in we shouted so the person did not come in and we do not know who it was.

Couples beware,"Booked a double room several months in advance for a 3 night trip to the Christmas markets with my wife, and was assigned a twin room at check in.  When making a booking for the Riu Plaza Berlin the twin and double room options are listed separately with different prices, however it seems if you take the double option, there is small print that states you may be assigned either a double or twin beds.  I've never seen this before when using booking.com, if a hotel has separate options, then it is normally for the specific room type.
I tried to get the room changed, only to be told that as I made the reservation through booking.com and not directly with Riu Plaza then there is nothing they could do.  I did check this, and if you make the same booking on the Riu Plaza web site, you'll find that that a double room booking is for a double bed, not assignment at check in.  I guess if you use a booking agency Riu Plaza considers you second class guests","Nice hotel, conveniently located for the metro.  Good choice of hot and cold food for breakfast",3.0,December 2022,"January 4, 2023",Deluxe Double Room,3,Couple,8.3
Check What You're Paying For First...,"That booking a Deluxe Double Room doesn't guarantee that you'll be given a double bed, despite the option to book a twin room being separate when booking for the hotel.
If you don't have a double room, don't advertise that you have double rooms and then just put people in twin rooms.
My girlfriend and I didn't want to ruin our trip, so we moved all the furniture around to have the two twin beds together, but the hotel shouldn't be advertising and allowing people to book the 'Deluxe Double Room' and then have in the small print that the bed type is not guaranteed.
Given a kettle and cups, but not given anything to use in them e.g. tea, coffee.
The screenshot of the hotel advertised would have you think that it's near the TV tower - this isn't the case... It's more than an hours walk away, but good effort by whoever photoshopped it in.
A quick heads up to anyone travelling from the UK with UK Shaving plugs - they dont fit into European sockets, and I wasn't able to find a suitable adapter in multiple tech shops in Berlin. There are no shaving plugs in the bathroom to charge electric shavers/toothbrushes etc. So, make sure you pack a shaving adapter for European sockets.
The TV in the hotel room was also fairly dated - whilst I understand that in Germany, the majority of channels will be in German (with the exception of BBC World News), the TV was a fairly dated model and unable to link to devices, so we were unable to stream anything to the TV that we might want to watch.
Still enjoyed the trip to the beautiful city of Berlin, but would be looking elsewhere for accommodation next time.","Juan, behind reception, tried to help us resolve the issues we had with the hotel, but didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel other than to wash and sleep.

We told him we just wanted to have 1 drink and he again mentioned the time and then rolled his eyes and said fine.

"it is okay, but there are far better hotels in berlin","although i was at 16 floor the windows were not from floor to ceiling to enjoy the view , rather a about a one more thick wall denying the view when you sit at the deka or from the bed
the room had a quality of five star, if they have kept it really clean. superficially was clean , but if you stay few days and also work couple of hours in the room, you notice the flaws
the hotel has 18 floors, but no roof bar , the only area to sit for a drink or coffe is at ground floor in a closed room, even the breakfast area is closed during the day, with view to the street.

We’ve put out a do not disturb sign on our door when we left the hotel the first day after our first night because we didn’t want house keeping to enter our room. We left all our clothes, valuables as they were because we thought no one would enter.
When we got back we noticed the male house keeper had entered our room and has moved the used lingerie of my girlfriend! He only did the beds an hasn’t touched any of the trash laying around or cleaned the bath, swapped towels.
This was all very strange and we felt very uncomfortable. After calling the reception about all of this I spoke to the hotel manager who gave us a „free welcome drink“ for the inconvenience.
