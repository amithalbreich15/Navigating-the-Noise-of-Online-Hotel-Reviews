Excellent hotel in a central location,Nothing that I didn't like.,"It was a fantastic hotel based in the centre of Old Town. So, everything was in walking distance, close to tourist attractions and all of the bars and restaurants. 
Super clean hotel, with a bar. We bought a bottle of wine from a shop and the bartenders gave us wine glasses and ice!
The beds were surprisingly large - small double - and super comfortable 
Beds were made, fresh towels l, bottles of water and sachets of coffee every day.
Loved that there was a hairdryer, shower gel,  shampoo and conditioner, too.",10,July 2023,"July 18, 2023",Twin Room,3,Group,8.9

I hung our towels up in the room as there was a sign to say hang them if you don’t need them washed (and we had only used them once); however they were taken away as well as our bath mat and not replaced. I called down to reception to ask for some towels and was brought just bath towels so asked for two hand towels too and then didn’t have the heart to ask for a bath mat too so we did without!","Clean, well situated and very friendly and helpful staff.

"Great hotel, great staff but sort out taxi booking processes!","Taxi booking experience was not good and although the terribly frightening experience we endured is not directly Hiltons fault I think you should have a better system for accessing taxis for collecting residents at the hotel. I understand the yellow cabs are notorious for ripping people off but even though we booked 2 taxis on 2 separate occasions direct via your reception we were massively ripped off on both occasions and had a very frightening experience by rogue taxis pretending to be the taxi booked via reception and the baffling thing is they had the taxi booking number. So Hilton, your process needs to be improved for resident safety. You should have a member of hotel staff who makes sure you physically access the correct taxi or the taxidriver should come into reception with proof he is the correct one otherwise your residents are at these sharks' mercy as soon as they set foot outside the door onto the street.",Staff very helpful with good English which was a blessing.

An excellent hotel requiring minor tweaks,"1. Request for daily cleaning: I wasn’t informed by the reception that rooms are cleaned everyday only if the guest informs the reception. There is a small blue notice on the mirror in the bathroom, with tiny text reading the same. However this can be easily missed. Upon return one day, the room wasn’t cleaned but the receptionist was kind to move me into another. I will recommend the hotel to consider placing paper tabs like “Do not disturb” ones, reading “Make up my room”, in the room; which can be hung on the door knob while exiting. 
2. There is no mention of the phone number of the reception on the phone and it was after a significant number of hits and misses I found it. 
3. The hotel could consider installing dedicated bathroom hairdryers on the walls then providing ordinary one which plug into the socket. This will reduce risks of electric shock and short circuiting , in an humid and wert environment, with the risk of water splashes. The ordinary ones are best suited to be used in the bedroom and not the bathroom.","LOCATION:
Exceptional!
From the Airport to the Hotel; Uber will cost between LEU 42 to 50; Taxi from LEU 45 to 55

Nice hotel with a (externally caused) catch,"The hotel is large, and it has one side that is facing a bit more shady area, which should be no problem, since you do not see anything about that when entering the hotel, and it is easy to avoid that area. However, if one's room is facing that street, there is a good chance that you will not sleep because of the very loud music coming from the bar ""El Commandante"". Several phone calls, they warned the police several times, and then the music goes down a bit, but when the police is gone, the volume goes up again. Officially, they are allowed to have the music until 11 PM, but it lasted at least until 2.30 AM.  Apparently the Romanian police is unable to close the bar, which essentially should happen of course, since they do this more often. The second night this happened, the hotel was fully booked, they could not offer me another room, only the day after they were able to. So, when booking this hotel (for the rest it is definitely worth the experience), make sure your room is not facing the side where ""El Commandante"" is.","The hotel is luxurious, rooms are of good quality, breakfast is very good, people are very helpful and friendly. In principle the location is great in the old town, but the catch can be found on the negative comments. In the end I got a few extras and a reduction in the price because of this.

Room view was horrible: firstly, there is a big pipe in front of the window which blocks half the view, then over the street is an old grey building bringing you to ""depression"", especially on a grey winter. 
Not having mini bar stuff in the room not optimal, even there is a small cornere at the reception where you could get whatever you want. And the cherry on the top, a 75 g buiscuits item does cost 15€. Even they are bio, this is beyond outrageous. 
At the bar in the evening, after 22 p.m. they don t have anything from the kitchen, not even a pie. I got it when they don't have anymore personal to cook, but the pies could be easily stored and served on the bar!

Absolutely horrible,One of the worst stays I have ever had. On Sunday night they had a wedding and reception at the hotel that the hotel allowed to continue until three in the morning. The rooms are not well insulated and so it was like trying to sleep in the middle of a club with music blaring. I understand hotels have these events and I would have been fine with midnight but 3 am is unacceptable and completely unacceptable for guests who paid money for a good nights sleep.

Good location in old town Bucharest,"Hotel staff not particularly welcoming when we checked in - no smiles although they did respond to my request and sent someone up with extra pillows as I was recovering from an injury. Later they were quite abrupt when we inquired about a taxi to the airport. They gave us the answers but with a very brusque attitude. No suggestions on where to eat even though we had asked that previously. We just were told “oh everywhere is fine. You’ll find lots of places.” And the walls are paper thin. There were people partying in the room next to ours. We had to call downstairs to the concierge twice well after midnight to ask them to send security up because the people next-door kept knocking on our door in the middle of the night. And even after Security came up and the knocking on our door stopped, the people next-door were so loud it kept us awake most of the night when we had to wake up at 5:30 AM to catch our plane.","Good location at the beginning of the old town of Bucharest.

Staff attentiveness may require improvement.,"We stayed for 3 nights and needed to change the room several times. 1st night- very noisy room facing the club and restaurant, loud music and vibration until 5am in the morning, over heated room and we couldn’t get the temperature down, could be the air conditioner malfunction. We asked for room changed and requested hotel to assist with luggage move as we will be out on walking tour in the morning. Hotel indicated they are unable to assist with luggage. We have to run up and down several times to move and change the room ourselves with addition runs as the card not working for new room etc.  2nd night- the basin plug was clogged, unable to use the basin as water wouldn’t go down, asked reception for help 3 times, said someone will check it out, no help while we hold off shower just in case someone will attend to the basin. No one turn up, so we were too tired after travel on the day and decided to leave it and sleep. We were using the shower facilities to wash hands, cups etc. at the interim, reminded reception again before going on day trip in the morning, reception confirmed will ensure this is attended to. We returned from day trip around 9pm, asked reception to check if the basin has been fixed, reception said no information left in the system, asked us to go into the room to check it out ourself.

A lot to improve,"The towels are of low quality, leaving some kind of dust on the body. The toiletries are also very cheap and of poor quality. The pillows feel old and cramped. The shower was very far from being clean - hairs and some yellow stains left from the previous guest.

The breakfast is a no go in my opinion. Some personnel from the kitchen has visibly very dirty clothes and has a heavy sweat smell. This is also a problem for the women who work at the omelette/waffles station. The quality of the food was not great. I have encountered spoiled vegetables several times.
And do not wear fresh clothes to breakfast, they will catch the smell. The ventilation is very poor.

One night I got a call at 5 in the morning from the reception. The person didn’t greet me or anything. They were insisting that I have ordered some food delivery in a very rude form until I simply hanged up. Of course, I could not sleep anymore. Nobody tried to make it up to me.

I can't describe all the instances that caused our early departure to another Hotel down the street but I was the best decision

Given the cost for a business stay at this location in Bucharest and a Staff that cannot deliver decent service I recommend you choose anywhere else as we did!!!","Location was excellent!!!
With the exception that the Staff wouldn't give us 2 minutes to assist or give us directions

Won't recommend this Hilton for any reason give the way we were greeted and put off during our stay.

What makes it worse is that I'm a Team Member and ashamed to admit it while I was there.

We had to move to another hotel to get better service, accomodations, food and to be acknowledged by the reception desk 
Do not book here!

Go down the street anywhere even next door for what your looking for in a pleasant stay in Bucharest",4.0,May 2022,"June 23, 2022",Queen Room,1,Couple,8.9
service below acceptable level,"third night, the cleaning lady forgot to clean the room. Came back exhausted from a conference at 8:00 pm. Receptionist said house keeping left at 4:00 pm..super.

Bad,It has dissapointed me that they have charged me a higher amount than my reservation in Booking was and even once they recognised that it was a mistake on their side they didnt pay me back the difference after two weeks. It is not acceptable for a Hilton hotel to procceed like this. Very unsatisfied.,,1.0,April 2022,"April 28, 2022",King Room,2,Family,8.9
"If you want to sleep at night, don't go !!!","it's close to the old part.

A big disappointment this time.,"Hilton failed this time. The coffee milk in the room was  altered/bad, as in the picture, the armchair was stained, there was no  shower cap, one girl at the reception behaved pretty rude and 3 out of 5 receptionists were not wearing the protective mask on the nose, in a Bucharest with a 6,5  per 1000 infection rate.","The bed and the pillows are very comfy, which is a big plus.",5.0,September 2021,"October 2, 2021",Queen Room,1,Solo traveler,8.9
I would never stay there again.,"Rooms are small, room service could be better. 
They put a kettle in the room, but no cups to make your coffee/tea.
We ate at the ""Beef Room"" restaurant which is the only restaurant in the hotel, and the service was so bad, the waiter forgot half of our order, and at the end when we ordered the bill we didn't get it, the waiter just told us what's the amount we needed to pay.

Exceptional,,"Exceptional hotel that is situated in the heart of Bucharest, 2 min from University and 2 min from the old town. 

But the location isn't the only one that makes this hotel amazing; the architecture is wonderful, with big rooms that are modern, spacious, bright and clean. The bathrooms are impeccable.

 Furthermore, the breakfast has a wide variety to accommodate each and everyone and everything is delicious. 
The rooms on the 7th floor have a breathtaking view of the city. 

Of course, 10/10 for the personnel from the cleaning crew, reception, restaurant to the management for their work ethics, professionalism. A special thank you for the manager of the hotel.
