I eas afraid that someone would open my door like had happened to the man in front of me that night and the next morning,"The manager was rude over the phone to a guest in front of me. That guest had all his belongings missing when he returned back to his room and the manager could not help him because she needed to sleep. She didn’t want the guest to speak this housekeeping but she would not help find his belongings. She insisted that he must wait until 10:00 am that she would start her work day. All of the gentleman’s frustration didn’t mean anything to this female manager that was raising her voice every time guest asked for an explanation of why his things had been taken out off his room.

Another guest could not open his door with his  key and was having to wait for this long discussion in the phones to be over. 
The third guest ahead of me was upset because when he arrived to his room their were people in bed sleeping. He had been given an occupied room. This guest also was frustrated because the desk host continued answering the phone and on the computer assisting the callers while we had to wait for problems to be solved. I was standing for about 30 minutes in line to check in. All I could think was that I had mad a mistake booking with you. I finally told the host to put all his calls on hold and take care of us.

We had a very trying evening at the airport between the delays at customs and security we missed our connecting and last,"After booking we called at 11:20 p.m. to inquire when the next shuttle to the airport would arrive? A Hispanic gentleman answered and said 12pm. I asked again when is the next shuttle? He stated every hour on the hour from 12pm-6pm. I stated the confirmation email I received stated the shuttle ran from 6am-12am, so is the next shuttle at midnight? Once again he stated the next shuttle is at 12pm. We were able to get the Comfort Inn Shuttle to take us and drop us off at the Days Inn. The young Hispanic gentleman who checked us in must’ve been in training, he made a number of mistakes and had to ask the other clerk a number of questions before we were able to get our room. Upon entering the room the light switch didn’t turn anything on, we fumbled and found the bathroom light switch to illuminate our way into the room. We tried watching the TV which turned on promptly with the remote however, an error message appeared stating  “weak signal or no signal;” We called the front desk and the clerk stated the Wi-Fi was down. So we connected our tablet to the hotel Wi-Fi and watched a movie.

The value was good and the room while not great did meet my expectations. The staff were good.,"My booking was supposed to be pay at the hotel with my credit card as a guarantee. However, they attempted to charge my card before my arrival. Also,  the booking said : Free shuttle from/to the airport/cruise terminal. However, when I contacted the hotel to arrange to be picked up at the cruise terminal, I was told they only did drop-offs. They had taken weeks to reply to my email about how to get picked up. This cause me additional cost. The ""free"" cruise terminal pickup was one factor I had considered in the cost of the booking. I do feel as I was scammed

From the cruise terminal, I took a cruise line transfer to the airport. At the airport, I used a courtesy phone about getting picked up. I was told where the pickup point was. After I arrived there, I waited an hour and 15 minutes for the shuttle. One other person waited longer. Other hotels seem to be on a 20-minute  rotation.

INCONVENIENCE.,"Where should i begin...

1. Its starts of from the Reception, for the lack of better words Unprofessional !!! , as a front liner for the Hotel they should atleast be, open for Questions, assistance , provide good Customer service and Friendly.. but anyone staying or even passing by that place would feel uncomfortable because of their attitude and response... 

2. The first room i was placed in had an issue regarding a leakage in the bathroom (a huge dent) so i had to call the front desk , there was no sign of manner nor apologise to the inconvenience...

From what i see the Front desk Crew they Lack professionalism and most if all sense of Belongingness for the Company in general... 

 I dont really know how far it would take the hotel with such a customer Service!!! If you ask me whether or nor i will recommend the place to other people id say No 10/10...

 how many people have had the same experience as me???...

Finally, In the company that i work work for we have this principle it goes like "" it takes time to get a customer and seconds to lose one""....","Cleaning staff's are so cooperative and open.

This is my first and last stay at this hotel.,"Let's start with the door.  It was jammed and when it was not easy to open or close.  The lock did not align properly with door jam, so, it was difficult to lock the door, and a portion of the door was sticking out from the frame when it was finally closed and locked.  The room was disgusting.  The floor was filthy, the walls were splattered with whatever the last people splashed on them, the whole room was battered from neglect by the hotel.  The tub was unusually slippery and it seems as if it was painted and the paint was peeling.  Nothing was updated or clean.  There were also small roaches crawling around the room, especially in the bathroom.  I questioned the cleanliness of the bedding, especially since there were a couple obvious stains/spots on the white blanket on top of the bed.  I slept in my clothes.  I didn't discover everything right away because I was so exhausted and stranded because of an unexpected overnight layover at Miami Airport after traveling over 12 hours.  If I'd reserved the room for more than one night I would have checked into another hotel after continuously encountering one nasty discovery after another.  I should have known the room would be trash because the entrance to the lobby was very unimpressive and the rugs look like they haven't been cleaned in a while.

"Just stay somewhere else, whatever savings you find in booking here are not worth it.","This was up there as one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had. Staff was not helpful and gave off an air of they would rather be anywhere else. The room itself was very small, the included furniture was too big for the space and it made it very difficult to move around and to find a spot to access inside our suitcases. The real issues were though the room itself was in very poor condition. It had not been properly cleaned, the floor was dirty (could actively see dirt and grim) and there were multiple hairs from previous guest(s) visible on the furniture. There was also water damage to a number of the furniture pieces and the walls/roof had visible cracks and water damage stains. We were also very disappointed to find that the WIFI did not work and as international guests visiting, having functioning WIFI at our accommodations is incredibly important. The washroom also didn't have a counter, only a very small pedestal sink and there was nowhere to place items like toothbrushes and toothpaste.","Very close to the airport, includes complimentary shuttle- however the service is very slow, we waited close to an hour for the shuttle to arrive ( the hotel is about a 10 minute drive from the airport, so even if we had just missed it, the math on this does not add up).",1.0,March 2024,"April 6, 2024",Queen Room - Non-Smoking,1,Couple,5.5

This place was a “motel” with actual “residences” living there permanently. The first room we were assigned, the outside door would not close properly. When we pushed it closed it got stuck and we couldn’t exit. The door had about a 2 inch gap at the bottom with dead cockroaches just outside the door. The TV worked but the picture was horrible. My husband complained so they switched our room which was between all the resident tenants. Around 7:45 the resident started to argue and the police showed up.

We dropped off our bags, asked about early check in, and we were told that they would get us in ass soon as possible and we’d be added to a “waitlist”. We were second on said list. So we had lunch and waited. Soon another family from our cruise showed up so we waited together. They were on the list as well. At about 2pm we asked again about early check in and were told that there were no 2 bed rooms available yet, to check back. 3pm rolls around, the actual check in time, and there still wasn’t a room ready for us.

There was mold growing in our shower, hair all over the bathroom, bugs crawling in the bathroom and on the floor. No bed bugs thank god.

This is a unpleasant place and stay to be at. Due to gossiping fro,I did not like to staffing. The maids complain about cleaning the rooms but yet that's what their job is required to do as well as the butlers. I even was questioned yesterday on my birthday if I myself was taking a video of your carts despite me only looking at my own phone. That's a little bit more than snooty to me while being here. Then the following day I was told I'm banned from here because of me having no idea that the person that I was with was not allowed to be here despite that being their job to notify me for me not to have others that are not allowed to be here while they work here to not have them here because supposedly that's my own parents even though and sell their job anyways to notify their customer who's allowed to be here or not even if that's your own parents or family or not at all their family. And previously I stayed here for a month and 5 days And they are telling me this a month and 5 days later. And as I am making this report they just tried to robbed money from my card even though I paid until tomorrow. And I already paid them in cash. I will be being dealt with as a staff that's nonsense. I already witnessed multiple customers are already coming from in front of my face screaming that supposedly their own bank is robbing them but yet you all are all saying the same thing so your customers and there's always a customer being robbed from their own bank. You all will be legally dealt with. And don't try to make excuses after because of my reservation because of my bank or because the lack of the inspection or because the person who hired you because this place and vicinity will be inspected legally.,And I did like was the place itself.,1.0,September 2023,"September 27, 2023",Deluxe Double Room with Two Double Beds - Non-Smoking,1,Family,5.5

The next day they were able to transfer me over to the correct room but that mistake should have never happened to begin with I don't care about the $30 refund it's still wasn't enough to redeem these transgressions. The cost of food is already high in Miami. We had to throw away food and have to resort to eating out it's already an unfortunate added expense. This hotel was supposed to be a relocation because the vacation home I booked with booking.com was not set up at all. It's been nearly two decades since I visited Miami and I was just mystified with not seeing any physical toll booths or actual specific signs that say when one tool area starts in another ends and what are the particular toll numbers  at each location to pay the designated amount online.

At arrival, I was told that the room is on 2nd floor and there is no lift. no help to carry the bag.
Room was filthy with hair on the bathroom floor, wash basin, rusty bathroom door frame,
rusty bed side table lamp which was flickering all the time and I had to put it off.
No hot water available. 
The night receptionist was playing video games and was least interested in my complaints and just said that he would mention to the housekeeping and maintenance of the issues above. I noticed that he was playing this video game with loud sound for more than 40 minutes when I waited for the airport shuttle.

Should have slept at airport,Hotel staff lied about airport shuttle times even though I called to confirm day my arrival. They stop picking up at 11pm not 2am like website says or even midnight like the clerk told me. We got in at 11:15 to no shuttle and had to use 2 Uber XLs so that was extra cost and the late shuttle was main reason we booked this specific hotel. They also misrepresented the shuttle availability to the ship terminal too. They do not have enough space for everyone and only offer 2 shuttles so we had to use 2 Uber XLs for that too. There is also no breakfast either as offered on website. There was Roaches behind headboards in both our rooms. We had to put our luggage in bathtub. Did not see any bed bugs. Could not shower. Water was all over bathroom floor. Vending machines and ice machines do not work. Beautiful clean pool.The hotel allows homeless people to hangout in the pool the enclosure the entire night and others roam the parking lot.

VERY POOR STAY (DAYS INN),"The toilet... It was clogged and couldn't flush for two days.

After I refused that option, he then suggested I can go over to the gas station next door to use it.. (Did I do any business with the gas station?)

The bath tub was rusty. The chairs and the lamps in the room were rusty. 

The so called airport shuttle runs late, though they day every 30 minutes. It didn't came until close to 2 hours after my arrival in Miami. 

Every night I heard men outside my door talking, smoking. An evening I walked by, one was asking me if I had Marijuana.

The refunded me $21 due to the discomfort saying I slept for the night, with the over flowing toilet filth/stench..

I booked this hotel because it's an airport hotel and I filtered it through booking.com for the shuttle. It turns out that they only have shuttle service from 6am, which is of no use for earlier flights. 
They wanted me to pay for a cab, said it was $17. They ended up reimbursing me for $17 but the cab actually cost $20 and a tip was expected...

One Thing After Another...,"My first room did not have any electricity, the lights did not work at all. When I brought this up I was told well if I ""really need the lights"" I can move to a different room. 
My second room did not have a fridge so I asked for ice for my cooler. Was told where the ice machine was. It did not have any ice. When I brought this stuff to staff and asked if they had any other machine she told me no and that I would just have to wait for ice. I had to go over to the gas station to get ice.
When I thought I had finally settled down for the night, I turned on the TV to realize that that didn't work either. I was told that I could get another room but at this point I had said this is already my second room and didn't feel like carrying all my luggage to a third room.
And the floors in both rooms were filthy. The bottoms of my socks were black. My second room did not have a deadbolt, it was broken and the door had been kicked in so the bottom of the door didn't shut all the way.

I was pissed off over this for entire 3-night stay at this hotel. my trip was ruined because of this. I had lots of work to do and had virtual meetings to attend which I was unable to do and got in trouble for. The front desk staff could not assist. Day and night I called, and everyone kept making excuses even after they confessed that almost all the guests were complaining about the same thing. My door had to slam shut, else it wouldn't be closed properly-it squeaked as it opened and closed and definitely needs changing.

Avoid this dirty out dated hotel if you can!,"Here’s the long speech. The hotel does not look like nothing on this picture. the rooms does not look like the pictures. my husband and I say that we have been “hotel/ fished.” For an example, the picture shows the pool on the rooftop but it’s really on the 1st floor. It was really that bad. We had an overnight layover and decided to give a basic hotel a chance. We were only going to be there for 8 hours. The hotel offers free airport shuttles between 6AM- 12AM so we figured why not.

When we got there, immediately we smelled a foul smell. The hotel smelt like cigarettes and mildew. Then we noticed that this hotel didn’t have an elevator. We had to carry 4 luggages up the steps. The upstairs looked disgusting. When we arrived to the room, their were restaurants brochures that were slid under the door. The windows had a lot hand prints on it. Everything were out dated and old looking. The walls had holes in it. The bathroom was a joke. They did not have the common curiosity of switching out the used toilet roll. My husband and I were afraid to even sleep in the bed. They had a least a 18 inch tv on the wall. Then I started breaking out in hives. We knew it was time to go even though we had a few hours before our flight.

We checked out the same hour that we checked in. It was people at the lobby either complaining about their room or checking out as well. This man was complaining about roaches in his room. 

Pleaseeeee do not consider this cheap option even if you are there just for a layover or for a cruise. It is not worth it. I would not bring my own children to this hotel. This has been the worst hotel experience that my husband and I both experienced. Going back to the airport was the better option for us. It actually felt cleaner than this hotel.
