Good value except housekeeping,"Housekeeping does not ""clean""  only straighten up and change out dirty towels. And it doesn't really seem like the rooms have had a thorough cleaning after each client. The towels seemed stale and didn't have a fresh smell to them.  They smelled like food.","Excellent location!!  Building is older, but we'll kept. Good value for the money.",8.0,August 2024,"August 10, 2024",Queen Room,4,Couple,8.1

Wonderful,"Hotel might benefit from its own restaurant/breakfast area, and from some modernisation.","Great city hotel, conveniently located with a very nice outdoor pool and well equipped gym.

Nice Second Stay,The only thing that was hard to deal with was the old AC controlling panel. It worked but it required multiple strong attempts.,This was our second stay here. Staff was as always very helpful. The rooms were in good condition. Even though we stayed at a smaller room this time (Queen instead of a King) we still had sufficient space.,9.0,July 2024,"July 21, 2024",Queen Room,2,Group,8.1
Wonderful,,"Staff helpfulness, spacious room, nice pool, great location",9.0,July 2024,"July 19, 2024",Double Room with Two Double Beds,3,Family,8.1
Comfortable and Convenient locatio,"The room is a bit old and the air conditioner is quite loud. But just minor stuff. 

What I like and also didn't like about it the most is the location. It's super convenient, but it's also located in an area where a lot of homeless people gathered. If you arrive late like I did and had to walk from the metro, expect that you may get screamed at randomly. I still felt safe walking there though, usually the homeless wouldn't do much to you except screaming and asking for money.","Staff was super friendly and helpful. The room is much bigger than I expected given how expensive the city is. Bed was very comfortable and clean. The location is also very convenient, a few minutes away is already a supermarket.",9.0,June 2024,"July 17, 2024",Petite Double Room,2,Solo traveler,8.1

"Great central location, clean rooms, very helpful and lovely staff!",Overall it was good. But I think if I had known there were rooms around the pool I would avoid these. I don't know how busy the pool is at night but I would have felt a bit exposed being in one of these rooms. We weren't! We were well away from it. But something to consider!,"This hotel was brilliant. The local was really central and easy to get to. It had a safe in the room and was clean. The staff are so helpful and quick. The air con is little old fashioned but once we were shown how it works, it worked really well for us. And the corridors and bathrooms are a bit old fashioned but it is a historic building and has been a hotel since 1928! It also has a pool, which was clean and a bonus really for a city break hotel. The hotel doesn't serve breakfast but they do offer a 20% off a local cafe which we used twice.",9.0,July 2024,"July 11, 2024",Queen Room,6,Couple,8.1
Wonderful,"When neighbors were opening adjacent room doors, our door moved due to air pressure and made loud noise. This disturbed our sleep in the mornings. We might have been unlucky with this room. If this wasn’t the case, I would have given the rating of 10/10","I loved almost everything about this hotel : Location, bed, facilities, etc...",9.0,June 2024,"July 10, 2024",Queen Room,5,Couple,8.1

A significantly pleasant stay at this hotel will forever be remembered and beckon me to return.,"The only thing that was disappointing is that the restaurant was NOT open.  Guess COVID impacted this facility financially, so this part of the hotel was not reopened.  I wrote the preceding based on other closed businesses that are in the Union Square area.  It was heart wrenching and sad.","The personnel were quite helpful in satisfying my needs.  I requested a room on an upper floor/quiet side and obtained both.  In addition to my room location, I was provided with 4 requested firm pillows to my delight.",9.0,June 2024,"June 9, 2024",Petite Double Room,1,Couple,8.1

Handelry value,"I was disappointed that you only got 2 sachets of tea and coffee and had to use powdered creamer, milk would have been better and 2 sachets goes very quickly.",The  central location and the ability to book an extra room that was connecting to the original room I booked. I loved that it had a  balcony where I could sit and have a coffee while watching the hustle and bustle of the city. I appreciate the  toweling robes and the body lotion in the bathroom. It was easy to get in and out of the shower as the bath wasn't too high and there were  grab rails for safety,9.0,January 2024,"January 30, 2024",Premier Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,3,Family,8.1

Great place to stay when visitng SF,"The restuarant is currently closed, but they provide a coupon for a nearby diner to have breakfast (and it's great).  OUr room was by the pool, which meant extra stairs each day (on top of walking around SF which is very hilly).","The location is perfect for visiting SF.

We had a great time,The hotel is a little bit dated. The carpet a little bit smelly in places. There were some homeless in the vicinity. I think the area is close to where a lot of homeless are camped. But I didn't see it as a big issue. I didn't feel unsafe. There were plenty of tourists and families around. I also wouldn't want to hide from the homelessness issue. It's an important issue. It feels irresponsible to just close your eyes to it all.,Pool was great for the kids. Outdoor and heated (a little). Location is good - right by Union Square and the start of the tram line. Rooms were clean and it met our needs well. When I called ahead of time they were very responsive - they accommodated my request to have a room with a balcony overlooking the pool. They also put a bottle of wine in the room for my wife's birthday. Great experience overall!

"Room was great, great location but the staff experience left much to be desired","Front desk staff was a bit abrasive and not very warm. Bellman ignored me when I was waiting to store my luggage and went out f his way to ask a Caucasian lady who walked in way after I was waiting if she needed to store her luggage and took her luggage to store it. A different bellman asked me if I needed help and I said I have been waiting to store my luggage and he told me to wait for the other bellman to come. I was so annoyed, I carried my own luggage to the storage where the first bellman was standing there on his phone having a personal conversation and seemed annoyed I was waiting for him to store my luggage and when he hung up he asked me if was going to store my luggage! As if I walked all the way there to watch him talk on his phone. He just took my luggage and handed me a ticket and walked away. I had to ask him when and what time I could retrieve my luggage and how long did they hold it for. That experience really tarnished my trip as it was my birthday.",Convenient location and very comfortable rooms,9.0,June 2023,"August 19, 2023",Queen Room,2,Couple,8.1

High end hotel close to Union Square.,The absence of a bar / restaurant for a high end hotel is strange but the 20% of Cafe Mason was very welcome.

A phone call doesn't go astray. I communicated this to staff who apologised on her behalf.","It was my first time in San Francisco and as a solo traveller I was hesitant if I had chosen the right location to stay in. I absolutely did!! Union square was central to everything via transport or on foot. The hotel itself had a welcoming, warm feeling that always made me feel safe, with 24-hr lobby staff. 
My experience on check-in was with a bubbly, friendly lady which couldn't have been more accomodating (wears a bow in hair - she was wonderful!) 
The rooms were cleaned daily and had everything I needed for a six-day stay. 
A HUGE shoutout to John (I hope that name is correct) at the front concierge desk. He is AMAZING! So knowledgeable! I wish I had spoken with him sooner. He showed me the areas to avoid, and the best methods of transport to get to my destinations and advice on how to pay/manage travel on the cable cars (even the best line to take for fun!)

"I actually told my friend that the H in Handlery now stands for Home, which shows you how much I enjoyed my stay here. J","Jack the bellhop was a little unprofessional. We kept saying we did not need his help with our luggage when we were collecting it from storage. But he insisted he was really free. We actually had fragile items and our work laptops in our bags and preferred to handle them ourselves. We were also going to repack some of our things in the lobby, but Jack took our bags to the door. We didn’t have enough cash on us and knew we could not tip him anyway, so his insistence made it very difficult and awkward for us, especially since we really didn’t need help with our bags. It also did not help that he loaded two bags that were not ours and luckily we corrected him and he gave us the right ones. Didn’t seem very professional considering how another guest could have easily claimed the bag was theirs and made off with it. He was also visibly disappointed at not being given a tip, and we are sorry about not being able to give him that tip. But we just wanted him to hand us back our luggages from the storage and did not need or want his help with them. That being said, this was probably the only less positive experience and even then, it was understandable.",Location was fantastic and we were able to get to everywhere we needed to go easily.

Perfect location for first time to SF.,For me - nothing. Was completely satisfied. The room and bathrooms were CLEAN and sheets and towels still white - my number priority anywhere I stay.,"It was our first time in SF and we asked for a room with a street view. Our request was not only accommodated but we were also upgraded to a bigger room in the new wing. The front desk staff, the concierge and the cleaning crew were friendly and helpful. The location was PERFECT! Union Square is a stone's throw away (literally). You only needed to walk to the corner and go to all the stores - from Macy's to high-end brand boutiques. We also caught the Big Bus for a quick view of the city at that corner. The street cars and cable cars and buses - all within a 5-15 minute walk (depending on how fast you walk). Boudin Bakery round the corner and in the Macy basement. In the new wing, we could go out the back/side entrances so after a long day walking, any shortcuts were appreciated. SFMOMA is a 15 minute walk away. Will definitely stay here again. Handlery has an old-world charm about it so while the furnishing is dated, it felt nice coming back to staff who greet you every time you walk through the door or ask about your day out. They even kept something in the freezer for me till I left as the room had a small fridge. Street is quiet but you can sometimes hear music or revellers at the bars nearby.

It was our honeymoon and they left us a bottle of bubbly and glasses in the room which was a nice touch. The bed was huge, air conditioning worked well and great bathroom.

Good hotel right in the downtown,"There were couple of things that had a little impact on my evaluation:
- Reception area had a ""funny"" smell, when entering the hotel. I was afraid at first that room will have the same smell, but it didn't fortunately. Maybe something to look at, because reception is really the place that makes the first impression on customers.
- Parking price was 65 USD + tax I guess - a bit too expensive, considering that you could park in the parking nearby for 35 USD (incl. tax). Not very customers-friendly.
- On one of the days, there was a demonstration right in front of the hotel (people were complaining about G Hotel or something), but they've been shouting outside for a good couple of hours right in the morning. Maybe not something that hotel can influence directly, but definitely wasn't the best part of my trip.","Location was definitely one of the best features of this hotel!

"OK hotel, great concierge","My room was very small and dated and had a slight odour.  I was exhausted from a 5hr drive so sprayed perfume rather than moving rooms.  I needed sleep.  
It's an old style, rabbit warren of a hotel.  I am not suggesting for a second that it's not safe but I was very relieved to have a room with a fire escape stairwell right next to it.  I took wrong turns going to the lift every time, so knowing I only had to step left in an emergency was good.
(I caveat this was probably not helped by being reminded on all the tours, that Towering Inferno was filmed nearby - and that film traumatised me as a child!!)
I did feel the Westin was only marginally more expensive on the nights I booked and would actually have been better value in hindsight.  So depends if you prioritise absolute prices or value per dollar spent.
It's worth bearing in mind, it's in the part of the city where you see the homeless.  I never felt unsafe - they are just people who life has let down after all.  But you should be ready for it. Also the dept stores all closed on Easter Sunday which caught a lot of us visitors out.  Absolutely not the hotel's fault and not a big problem but again something to consider when planning your stay.","Location is good if you want to be in the shopping district.  Some gorgeous buildings in the vicinity, if you like that kind of thing - I do.  Danny the concierge is a hero and couldn't have been more helpful.  
It was about a 30 min walk to the Ferry Terminal   for context.  There is public transport but the weather was nice.",7.0,March 2024,"April 17, 2024",Queen Room,2,Solo traveler,8.1

If you've never been to SFO, it's very in your face. We weren't hassled by anyone. But it can be an eye opener.
The whole city wreaks of weed and wee!
See past that and it's still a great base for a West coast adventure, to start a cruise as we did or just visit the city","Nice big room, bit of a hike to get to but worth it.
We been to SFO and stayed before, so we had an idea of the location of the hotel.
Close to Union Square, shops and bars. Still classed as near/in the financial district, so much quieter in the area than our visit in 2019, following from the pandemic.

Slight issue with the loo one morning but this was resolved.  Ideal location just off Union Square - easy walk for cable car/metro/Big Bus and shopping.  Given a voucher for discount off at the diner around the corner - think everyone in the area had a voucher as we did have to queue outside for a while.

Wonderful,"Hotel bar is still closed (and they had a really nice bar) which is a bummer. And the neighborhood is really getting worse and worse, with high levels of homelessness, and with many restaurants still closed. Of course outside of the hotel's control, but this is a reason why they should work harder to get their own bar back up and running.

Most hotels are in this neighborhood so it's strange that the City of San Francisco doesn't seem to care about the neighborhood at all. Though the rooms are well maintained and have been partially updated, some things like temperature control really should be upgraded; the buttons barely worked, only if you pushed real hard. Lowest fan setting was still loud, though that's not an issue with ear plugs.","The rooms are nice, value for money is really good. I got a complimentary upgrade which of course made it even better!

Poor,"I've stayed here many times. Because it was a short overnight I got a queen room with no view. As soon as I entered the room the musky, almost moldy smell hit me. It was as though the room hadn't been aired out for months. I was too tired after traveling to move rooms but found it hard to breathe freely the entire time I was in the room. When I checked out I was faced with two flights of stairs to get to the parking garage. The elevator didn't work the first two times I tried so I didn't chance it. I'm not disabled but have mobility issues and this was quite challenging. Thankfully a nice worker came by and carried my bag up the stairs for me to make it easier.

Overall okay,Unfortunately negative first-up interactions experienced and observed with one staff member at check-in tarnished the overall ‘feel’ about the property. The staff member was not patient or in my view genuinely friendly. Please remember guests may have been on long flights with little sleep. Courtesy and friendliness make a huge difference. Visible impatience with guests over completing the eftpos payment method doesn’t help. These are not the same ‘machines’ as overseas so some guests may initially take a while to orientate themselves. Elderly guests need even more understanding and patience. The rest of the staff were great. Thank you.,"Location

"Great location, bad receptionists, bad view","2 things I did not like; 1) The staff in the reception treated me unprofessionally, I came to San Francisco for a conference and my time was limited, and when I arrived at the hotel for some reason, the 3 VISAs did not work for them and the staff was not experienced enough dealing with VISAs, and they asked me to pay cash for the first day till they solve the problem, I came next day and they deactivated my Room card and my stuff was inside and they did not let me in unless I pay the full amount, I told them my visa is working fine and I just did a shopping using it, I waited for the manager and he did the transaction and it worked, then he taught the receptionist how to do it.

The second thing was they put me in a room where the window faces the other rooms (See the pictures) and this picture was not shown on the website when I booked the room and I paid the same price as the other room.

Our bags were brought to us on arrival however on departure when we requested assistance, as we did not know how to take the bags (4 plus carry on) from the 2nd floor to the lobby. After waiting 20minutes we called again only to be told they were too busy and still did not offer advice.  My husband and I were attempting to take the bags ourselves when one of the cleaning staff assisted us to a disabled elevator to use.

"Some Good, Some Bad -- But a mostly comfortable stay","A note about staff: we didn't interact with many staff at all, and none of the cleaning staff. I don't want to get anyone in trouble, so I will be vague about certain details, but it did impact my stay enough to warrant a mention. Firstly, my partner and I aren't the best dressed--we're often mistaken for being homeless, and having just come in from the Pride event, we looked a bit worse for wear. In the course of events, I noticed that, while we were met with curt, quick comments and what seemed to be an air of disdain, there was a much more pleasant attitude to the other guests. I don't really care about this, personally, but it saddens me to think this might be a common experience for people who *are* struggling and/or just trying to find a nice place to stay. The second thing regarding staff, which did bother me personally, was that despite being referred to as male by my partner (and having male designations on my profile), I was misgendered by a member of staff who was definitely aware of the preference. They immediately corrected, but it was extremely frustrating, especially having just come from Pride and wearing trans colors prominently. It was overall uncomfortable and disheartening.

Beyond that, the only other issues were a few things in the room. The first is that the window in the bathroom wouldn't latch shut, so we did hear a lot of outside noise pretty prominently. This wouldn't have been as much of an issue, if it weren't for the bathroom door. The door to the bathroom didn't slide open easily, getting stuck halfway. I must admit that if it weren't for my partner, I wouldn't have been able to open it myself. The last thing is that the towels in the shower area were a bit too high for me to reach from the wheelchair, but there was a towel placed on the back of the toilet, so I was able to access that myself without trouble. I also appreciated that the mat was placed on the toilet within easy reach.","I liked that the hotel is close to Westfield Shopping center, Trader Joe's, and bus terminals; so we were able to find a space to explore within a reasonable distance as well as travel around the city. When I mentioned prior to arrival that I would be arriving in a wheelchair, the awesome staff updated us to an accessible queen room at no additional cost, and it made the stay much more comfortable overall--I was surprised at how comfortable the bed was! 

The curtains were great at blocking out light and were easily adjustable. We had plenty of room, with the shower being fully accessible (minus one or two details, listed below), including a fold down seat and reachable handles with lower shower head. 

The mini fridge (which I didn't notice at first!) was really helpful, since I (unfortunately) have an extremely limited diet which requires a lot of produce and perishable foods. I appreciated the access to the cold storage very much!

Outdated facilities and rooms in dire need of a facelift,"By far one of the most disappointing hotel experiences I've encountered, given the value of the rooms were nowhere near commensurate to how oudated the facilities were. The room was clean, but had I knew how dingy and old the room/hotel facilities were, I would not have paid the money that I did to stay just the two nights here. The view looking out was also appalling, despite my requests for a city view. Instead, my view looked out to a square block of the adjoining hotel rooms, and just wasn't what I had hoped for. Upon checking in, I observed a hotel guest complaining to management about issues with the shower and overall functionality of the room, which in hindsight, should have been a dead giveaway just how my stay was going to be no different. The fact that management confirmed, in writing, that the hotel had gone through a recent renovation (including to the bathrooms) is false and misleading in my opinion. The bathroom appeared to be very retro-like, and looked as if it hadn't been given a facelift since the 1980s.

We'd booked a family room for 3 people so this was a real juggle. The bathroom was also tiny with very small bath towels. The corridors (we'd obviously been put in the old wing) were creepy and very dark. My sons spotted some much nicer rooms than ours when looking for the pool so we felt a little cheated as these were the ones that obviously feature in the images.

Stay at “hotel zeppelin”. Same price and location and hotel and rooms are VERY nice.  Ok the Handlery.. it’s old. very old. Run down. The room we had felt like one of the cells at Alcertraz! There was a window but it let in no light. It was frosted and painted shut so you couldn’t open it. It was probably looking right at a brick wall.  You turned on the shower and it sounded like you had just turned on a motorcycle engine. So loud. Carpet old and the whole room felt wet. Just grim and so expensive. The pool was the reason we booked here and due to the fact that it’s between buildings it didn’t get the sun at any point in the day so it was too cold to hang out there.
