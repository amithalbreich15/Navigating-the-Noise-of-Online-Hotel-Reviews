Good value for money.,The elevator must be updated with mirrors all around REMOVED. Some furnisher needs changing,"I had stayed here last year also but then the conditions were bad. The air conditioning at the time was very poor and I had to put in requests for it to be rectified. However, it was a pleasant surprise to see that the issue had been resolved. They are refurbishing, I think, and there are signs of it. But, some of the furnishers need replacing. 

Maybe it was one off, but it happened that my flight was delayed and I wanted to update the reception about my arrival time. No one ever picked up the phone as I tried desperately from the airport The number was correct as proved later and I had obtained it from Booking.com portal at the time of booking. I even called a friend to inform the hotel reception but it was not possible to connect. A major negative! The staff is generally welcoming. The breakfast was better but lacked the vow factor, The room was well kept and clean.
