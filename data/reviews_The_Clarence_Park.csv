Nice hostel. Easy to get there and well equipped!,"Breakfast time was a bit short (8-10 am). We  went there at 9 am and wanted to eat cereals but milk was empty. So we asked if there's more milk but they said no and didn't refill it. So we put water in the already made cereal bowl instead...

Really Convenient to Train Station and Comfortable Safe Place to Stay,"Well there was only one toilet (in building 10) and shower and they were in the same room meaning while you were using either, you wondered if there were people busting outside waiting to use the bathroom.  There was also really nowhere to plug your device outside of the room and use it.  Maybe if was in the building where reception was located these things might have been different but in building 10, needs more toilets and places to plug in and use your device.  Not really the acceptable thing to be a dorm room using a device. Also being so many people catch The Canadian and trains east which go early in the morning, it would be great if breakfast would start at least an hour earlier than 8am, being we need to walk to the station and Via demands us there an hour early.","Mixed dorm room and bed was excellent, really comfortable and spacious, even had shower type curtain around bed for privacy. I loved that there was a self provide the lock locker in room that was big enough to fit a backpack and more in. Numbered to match your bed so they don't fill up before you arrive.

Good value for price,"The check in time is very late (3 pm) and the check out is at 11. There is no possibility of an earlier check in even if you have a flight that arrives super early. The staff could be more friendly, they rotate a lot and most of them were not very 
kind.
There is a homeless camp in the square right in front of the building, we didn't have any problems with them or any odd situation but it is worth mentioning.","The location is great! You can go walking to CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Scotia Bank arena, Chinatown... there is also a metro station near by and it's close to Union Station. Breakfast has a good selection of basic itens and the kitchen has all the necessary utilities if you want to cook.
It's a good money for value option. I booked a single room with a private bathroom and it was great for a short stay. It was 
a lot cheaper than most of the hotels in the same region, the room is small but has everything we needed, the AC worked well.
We were able to leave our bags in the locker before and after check out.",8.0,May 2024,"June 6, 2024",Deluxe Queen Room,6,Couple,7.7

It's just pretty much the best room you can buy in Toronto if on a budget and travelling alone.,"Note that I only had to interact with the staff for check-in and for check-out. But I felt they lacked warmth (no smile, no chat or banter or asking about my stay). They did do their job professionally none-the-less. Maybe they just have a ""hands-off"" approach, since guests can walk in and out as they please, as well as use the kitchen or living room area freely, while they are staying at the hotel.

It's not a dealbreaker at all, though (since you really only have to check-in and check-out), and it could be attributed to a number of factors. I either expected too much, or got unlucky in these moments!","It's not luxury and you'll probably end up sharing the room while sleeping in bunk beds but the price is excellent and can't be beat. I stayed there fifteen years ago and I loved it so much then that I had to book it again when I had to visit Toronto in 2023. Saving money on lodging made me appreciate my whole visit in town even more, since I could spend more elsewhere if I wanted to.

I loved the location; everything is under 20-30 minutes on foot, and it's next to the tramway line and not far from the city bus line. The place is clean and quiet (it's not like a commune or a backpacker's hotel, but more like a bed & breakfast).

Good,"So, there was a problem, when one of the guests took a different bed than he was supposed to (let's say bed nr. 1 instead of 2). I completely understand the confusion of the person, who was supposed to sleep in bed 1, finding someone sleeping in their bed in the middle of the night.
But the whole situation could've been handled in so many different ways...However, the manager on duty, apparently approached by said person, decided to storm into our room at 3:40 am and start yelling at the person in the wrong bed. Waking up every single soul in the room wasn't the worst. The worst was, what he was yelling at the person. Imagine being woken up in the middle of the night with accusations that you are illiterate and you are lucky you won't be thrown out on the street right away...it ended up how it must've ended in every possible scenario - the person who was supposed to sleep in bed 1 slept in bed 2 (the only clean bed in the room), the person who caused this incident was charged double price for the night. Fair enough. But this conclusion could've been reached without such awful accusations and unnecessary yelling in the middle of the night.","+ the location

Excellent private hostel room with great views and lovely staff.,"The WiFi dropped out for me which was inconvenient when I needed to rearrange travel plans.

There was an unexpected dog fee which seemed really high compared to the price of the room. Apparently it's advertised on Booking.com but I didn't see it and it came as a nasty surprise to me. I stay with my dog in all sorts of places and the fee was one of the largest I've had to pay. It probably would have played into whether I chose to book this accommodation in the first place, despite how pleased I was with the service when I arrived.","The staff and the location of the hostel absolutely made it. Everyone was very happy to help me when I had to arrive with a stupid number of heavy bags.

She is better stay in the front desk where her work assigned to serve the guests. Now, she is always disappeared from the front desk. So, the guests need to find her where she enjoys chatting in the kitchen. I don't like the bed because it is too old and thin that really really uncomfortable to sleep. Again, the room is very messy by the guests because most of the guests washed their clothes in the room and put their stuffs on the floor so no where to walk.  The room is stinky because of drying the wet clothes on the bed frame. Also the room is tiny.","I like cleanliness, location, serving breakfast and some drinks.",7.0,September 2022,"September 19, 2022",Bed in 8-Bed Female Dormitory Room,1,Solo traveler,7.7

"Cheap and decent, but corner-cutting (no breakfast)","This place had the worst ""breakfast"" I've ever seen. The ""breakfast"" in the kitchen was just a bag of instant oats and a bag of walnuts that looked like they'd been left behind by previous hostel guests. No fruit, no bread, no yogurt or cheese or milk, nothing hot or cold at all. Just dry oats. Very disappointing--everyone went and bought a real breakfast somewhere else. I would have been less disappointed if they had just said they didn't have breakfast at all, because they really didn't.
I got stuck waiting to check in for about 30 minutes, with many others, because there was no staff member working even though it was check in time. 
Also there weren't any lockers in the rooms, just tiny safes to hold a wallet and keys.","The dorm rooms were spacious, and I liked the cute decorations around the common areas.

Good,"All staffs are wonderful except a receptionist, who works at the counter. In my opinion, she needs to learn customer service and serve customers what they require. She is better stay in the front desk where her work assigned to serve the guests. Now, she is always disappeared from the front desk. So, the guests need to find her where she enjoys chatting in the kitchen. I don't like the bed because it is too old and thin that really really uncomfortable to sleep. Again, the room is very messy by the guests because most of the guests washed their clothes in the room and put their stuffs on the floor so no where to walk.

My room was 2nd floor of next door of hostel and on the 1st floor it has a bar

"Fantastic location, friendly staff and good facilities","Room was very cold at first- the main window wasn't fully sealed so there was a freezing cold draft (I placed a towel in the crack and took care of the problem). The room wasn't dirty by any stretch, but there were a few hairs that I found in the bedding that were not mine, not the best considering Covid is still circulating so cleanliness should be a priority :( The rooms weren't soundproofed so I could hear everything from the other rooms, as well as the bar next door (on the weekends, noise went on until 2am). Not the fault of the hostel, but worth a mention.","Amazing location, right in the middle of downtown! Can't ask for a better location for the price. Staff were friendly on check in, I kept to myself most of my trip but everyone I came across was friendly and accommodating. I was in room 11, lovely and spacious- super high quality for a private hostel room. Great shower and you could see the CN Tower from the window! :) The bed was comfortable and the room also included a desk, good sized fridge, TV with lots of channels, clothes rack and a lounging chair.

And I ask them what the difference was between me and someone else booking on Booking, and then the promptly shutdown the booking capabilities on Booking. Then the manager extended my stay… They also mentioned parking to me, but they said it was very “limited.” Upon further clarification from the manager once again, all the parking was rented out to the construction crew for the building near by and not just “limited,” but completely unavailable! Staff failed to mentioned upon check in that codes to get into each building were on the back of the keys. Staff also failed to mentioned that we had a whole top roof patio deck where we could hang out. Get ready to just visit with the manager multiple times to discuss the many different failures in communication from management to the rest of the staff. Showers in building 7 had doors that didn’t shut all the way, so they leaked onto the floor. And showers in building 10 had shower heads that went over the top of the shower onto the floor and extra toilet paper area. Butttt overall would book again knowing everything I know now!","Great location, very comfortable, and only about a 10 minute walk to the bus station.

"It was one of the only hostel available in Toronto, well located and good price","the restaurant/bar attached to the hostel is super noisy especially during weekends and you have to go through their door and patio to access one of the hostel's building.
The bathroom was dirty and never cleaned on a daily basis, the bath itself was rusty at some part ...yark !!!

Very Good,"Overall, the positives of the hostel far outweigh the negatives and it's a great place to stay close to the main downtown areas! There are just a few things I would note for improvement. 
There was no air conditioning in the room, only a very noisy fan that obviously couldn't be put on at night, so the room was hot and humid much like outside.
There was also no privacy curtain at one end of my (bottom) bed, and there was another top bunk with none at all. I feel there should be consistency with this and that you should have the option of a curtain covering all public facing parts of the bed (ie not the part against the wall).
There was also no light in one section of the room - this didn't affect me but it should be changed.
Luggage space was mentioned in other reviews and I feel this could be looked at if there is space. I was lucky enough to have a perfectly sized gap between the bed and the wall in which I could store my luggage, but others had to leave theirs in the room.
Just as a note, there are two separate buildings and to access the second one, two doors down, you have to go through the outdoor marquee area of the bar in between the two hostel buildings. As Number 10 building was right by the bar and the weather necessitated keeping the window open, there was noise from music and patrons' chatter. However, this was never overly loud and it was often quiet by around 11.","The location of the hostel couldn't be better - from my bed, I could see the CN Tower. Only 15 minutes walk max from that area and Union Station. To the north, Chinatown and Kensington Market were also around 15-20 minutes walk away, with some nice places for breakfast along and off Spadina Avenue. 
I thought the bathroom facilities were good, there was plentiful toilet paper and the shower was well separated from the rest of the bathroom so there was no splash or anything. The only thing to be aware of would be that the bathroom is within the room so there might occasionally be a wait to use it if the room is full.
The staff were helpful and friendly when I arrived, even offering to help me with my luggage. The common areas in the main building seemed in good condition and spacious, including the main kitchen.",8.0,August 2021,"August 21, 2021",Bed in 6-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,4,Solo traveler,7.7

Did not get what I paid for,"It was not what I paid for. I booked the deluxe queen room (also called the premium room on website). The room I was in was nothing like the photo. It looked more like the standard queen. The photos show a balcony, desk, and tea/coffee facilities. None of this is in there. You get a TV that I couldn't make work and a mini fridge. I knew there would be stairs but there's 2 flights of extremely narrow, steep stairs I had to get my large bag up and down myself. And to get to reception you had to go down the two flights of stairs and then go outside and across to another building.
I tried to get this fixed but they said the room I got is all there is. They advertise that it's recently renovated, maybe in the kitchen area but all the rooms are old and dingy. The tiles in my bathroom were all cracked and the wood lino in the bedroom was looking shabby.
There is a bunch of tents in the little park over the road - to be honest I hardly saw any homeless around them and they didn't bother me at all. It didn't even have a lot of rubbish around.

Property responded that request could not be guaranteed. I phoned the property on arrival day to advise my train was arriving late and once again made the special request. Was told beds were assigned only upon physically checking in at the property. When I finally arrived for the two-day stay a lower bed was assigned. Later that evening, the attendant knocked on my door to tell me that I would have to check out in the morning, bring my bags down to the storage office and check in again after 3pm. I agreed only because he promised that a lower bed was guaranteed on the property’s ground floor. The next morning I followed the given instructions and was re-assured of the stated arrangement, he even indicated that I was assigned to room #6.  I was told I did not need to re-check at exactly 3pm, that my assigned room and lower bed would be held until 2am. After a day of sightseeing and dinner, I arrived back at the property at 10pm only to be informed by the check in clerk that my room assignment was not room 6 and the bed was not a lower berth. I Immediately became livid and refused to accept this and demanded that my prior arrangement be honored. I was told that there were no more lower beds available. Very fortunate for me, the night attendant was also in the reception area and intervened. The night attendant had been present earlier that morning when I dropped off my bags for storage and heard when I was speaking to the manager about the inconveniences I was experiencing with changing rooms. He immediately found a solution by instructing the clerk to switch room assignments with other guests that had not yet checked in. I was finally assigned to a lower bed even though the room was on the third level of the property.

Lousy facilities and rude customer attitude from hotel manager Kendra Rogers (Ms),"I will send up a separate email to elaborate and voice out my dissatisfaction. In this hotel, (1) NO shampoo and conditioner was available, something different from what booking.com had published earlier and after double checking with the staffs a few times. (2) Air conditioning was NOT working and when reported to the manager Kendra Rogers (Ms), NOTHING was done till the next day, shouldn't all facilities be ready even before guests check in? (3) Fan was giving me problems too. I will attach a video to show, the cover of the fan, which is made of GLASS, FELL off when I pulled the switch a few times to see if it was really working. When reported this case to the manager, by showing her the video, I was ACCUSED for pulling too hard till it dropped. My question is, if the fan is really so firm and solid without swaying or unstable when I pulled to switch on, will the glass cover even drop? How shall I pull the switch then to prevent the glass cover from dropping since it's so high up??? The best part is there was no chair in the room for me to reach the fan switch... Thank goodness, the glass cover had landed on my bed directly and did not break, if not I will have to ask for injury compensation!!!
I remembered and heard very clearly that Kendra promised a 50% off the total bill over at the counter when I approached her after showing her the video of the lousy fan. But to my surprise, the receipt reflected was only 15% of the third night stay when I double checked. When bumped into her on morning of Thursday 16 May, she simply brushed me off by saying the refund stated is the correct amount... Is that really so???
I really don't think it's reasonable for customers to pay a total of CAD 510.29 for such a hotel with lousy facilities and customer service attitude (being a manager) who is defensive and can accuse customers for spoiling the fan...",Location that's all,1.0,May 2024,"May 25, 2024",Deluxe Queen Room,3,Solo traveler,7.7

Horrible treatment to the guests.,"I was treated very badly and felt threatened by the doorman upon my arrival.
I arrived earlier because the bus got earlier to the city. I had already asked the hostel if I could leave my luggage there until the check-in time, because I knew there was a good chance that that could happen. I was told that I could and that there was no problem with it. So, when I got to Toronto I went straight to the hostel.
Then, the person in charge who opened me the door treated me in a way I never expected to be treated.
When he opened the door he asked me, and I quote, ""What do you want"". It already seem odd for such a welcoming. I then proceeded to explain him that I had a reservation, that I had arrived earlier and that I was told it was possible to leave my luggage there until the checkin time.
He replied that ""It was rude of me to walk around with my fuc*** attitude"" and that he would only let me in because ""he was nice""
After he let me in, he told me that ""if I made any trouble I'd be answering to him"". Then he said that ""I should feel lucky that he opened the doors for me"" and that ""I'd better leave a fuc*** good review""
Honestly, I felt a little menaced by this welcoming and fairly unsecure. He made me feel like I was a criminal and all I did was arrive there earlier, something that is allowed to happen when you're a travelling tourist .
The thing is, I really wasn't being rude at all. I never expected to do the checkin or anything like that before the scheduled time. I never wanted any sort of special treatment. I literalley just wanted to leave my luggage there because I was told I could do it! In fact, I asked for it in advance before making my reservation, because if it hadn't been possible I wouldn't have booked here
The most annoying thing is that if it was too early indeed, he could have just told me to wait at the reception and I would have gladly done so.","The hostel was well located, and the 4 mixed bedroom was nice.

The staff we dealt with weren't unfriendly, but they weren't particularly warm or accommodating either. There is a huge poster in the kitchen with all the rules of the hostel on it, which ends with you being ""removed"" if you don't follow the rules. Of course a hostel needs rules, but I've never had them rubbed in my face in such an unfriendly way. Check in after 9 pm costs 15 CAD although the reception is officially open until 9 am. We left a towel with slight traces of cosmetics, for which we were charged 35 CAD. In addition, our room smelled of weed every time we were absent for a longer period of time and the floor tiles in the bathroom were cracked and some  pieces even came loose from the floor. We had a private room and yet not a single service during our 4 day stay, no new towels, toilet paper etc.. Overall, the price for a private room with this level of service was totally unjustified. Only the really central location is really recommendable.","The big plus of this hostel is its very central location. We had a private room with a direct view of the CN Tower.

"Unsafe, very loud place with incompetent management","I typically prefer to give constructive feedback, but my experience leaves me no choice but to be blunt. This is far from my first stay at the hostel. But this stay was an utter fiasco, marked by a blatant disregard for guest safety and comfort. Despite the hostel's favorable location, the night was marred by the a loud noise from a neighbor — incessant phone calls, conversations, and media noise throughout the night literally. I literally did not sleep all night, even trying to use my noise cancellation headphones. Appeals for peace were futile, hinting at a serious safety concern, especially given the lack of posted rules to reference such a situation.

The so-called ""night silence rules"" were a myth to my ears and, apparently, to my neighbor's as well. Not once was I made aware of these rules, nor were they enforced, making any attempt to cite them both dangerous and impossible.

When I sought refuge from this chaos by requesting a refund for the remaining nights only, the receptionist's demeanor was as deplorable as my attempts to sleep. The offer to refund a last night was a slap in the face, considering the sleepless agony I endured.

To add insult to injury, the management's outright lies to the booking.com about my request for a refund is reprehensible. Such dishonesty is inexcusable and paints a clear picture of the lack of integrity that runs rampant at this place. This isn't just poor customer service; it's a complete failure of hospitality.

Go somewhere else. Pay more for another hostel,"So, the free breakfast is from 8am to 10am, which starts quite late and means a lot of people are going to be waiting at 8am. The kitchen where breakfast is served is not especially spacious, so it'll be like sardines in a can. No space to eat. It is also very basic. It's basically the cheapest cereals, the cheapest bread, and the cheapest spread (except for jif peanut butter).

I stayed in a shared room, namely room 6. Since the walls are paper thin, despite being two walls away from the living room, and despite the hostel having a policy required guests to be quiet past 11pm, I could hear people shouting and playing music extremely loudly at 1am, and the staff that was about 5m away did not tell them to stay quiet. And then the very same at 8am, when someone was also blasting music for the whole hostel to hear. The beds do not really have power outlets, there is a multiplier right between the top and bottom beds, so on top of the plugs unplugging in the middle of the night because of how flimsy the multiplier is, bring cords that are at least 1.5m (~2 yards). Moreover, the bed themselves are extremely flimsy, so any minor movement in the top bunk and the whole bed is going to shake like crazy. 

Finally, and this I'm writing separate from the room because of how disgusting and unsanitary it is, my bathroom was filled to the brim with massively furry black mold. In the picture you can see the mold by the shower door and on the bathroom floor. Make what you will out of that

There is one bathroom for at least 2 dorms. So it's shared between at least 12 people. This makes the bathroom quite busy, and more importantly, unclean. I did not dare take a shower without my slippers on. There was also no soap or shampoo in the bathroom and toilet paper was scarce.

Front desk seemed to be interested in charging us rather than assisting. They did not borrow locks for the safes, instead they were selling them...

Towel provided was tiny (I've had bigger flannels to wash my face with), and a charge for another tiny towel which would've been pointless. Privacy curtain on beds were great for their purpose but my god, they were gross - mine was hanging off the clips, and stained to hell with whatever was on them. I thought it was cheeky that the hairdryers required a (refundable) deposit - I've never had this in a hostel before. The rooms need a major face-lift - I didn't feel comfortable or clean, but factoring in the price paid compared to local hotels in peak season, and the location, I've scored in the middle for this reason.","Location was great, curtains on the beds were also great for privacy (and to shut out light) in the rooms.

This time men were at the reception, I arrived after 11 PM so I had to pay a late check-in fee 15CAD$. And in cash. I had to go look for the cash machine.

I wish they’d just tell us from the beginning and we can plan better instead of driving in the city with horrible traffic trying to find a place to park.

This is a really horrible hostel!!!,"1st, I never ever paid late check-in fees in any hostel, motel, hotel etc. in my life. I've been traveling so many places. Most of time I stayed in hostel. They didn't show they will charge you $15 for the late check-in in the policy on the website. It's only showing check-in until 9 PM. There already have 3 people were waiting for check-in when we arrived there around 9:30 PM from the airport. There was only one front desk. And he asked everyone to pay $15 cash for late check-in fees. I really have no idea how and why especially in ""TORONTO"". How come you think the guest can all arrive before 9 PM? It's really depends on the flight and bus. And you are not even showing this on your policy. They should not charge any extra fees.

2nd, they offer a complimentary breakfast 8 AM - 10 AM but never on time. First morning was about 9 AM, everyone was waiting in the kitchen and confused. Second day morning was about 9:20 AM. Third day morning I went to kitchen around 9:30 AM, still nothing. I went to front desk and asked him. The guy just said, ""Oh, I'll check with staff."" Not even say sorry to the people who waiting so long for the breakfast. If you're not happy to offer a complimentary breakfast then don't tell everyone when we check-in. It's kind of cheating.

3rd, I bought a big cake. I put into the fridge and wrote my name, room number, leaving date on it. Day after morning when I checked out I couldn't find my cake. The fridge was so clean and empty. I told to a front desk, he said, ""I'll ask the staff.""

He was quite rude and a bit aggressive, we were surprised at his reaction. We left and he finally came to remove mop heads (!) from the washing machine that was right below our room. During the day we also asked about soap and shampoo missing in our bathroom as it is written on the Booking ad, but a lady (after waiting for a while as staff members didn't care to come talk to us) told us they don't have that anymore, and she was quite rude too.

Poor,"Charged me an extra $15 to check-in after 9pm. Indicated nowhere on Booking.com (they told me I should have checked their website, yeah sure), but the worse is that I had actually arrived at 1pm but was told I couldn't check in yet and had to go away. OK fair enough, but how hard would it be to warn me of the fee if I was to come back after 9, or to just do the check-in straight away, I didn't even need to access the room (not that they even took the time to check if maybe it was ready). So they just take $15 off of you (cash only, it definitely goes in their pocket taxfree) for what exactly ? Looking at your passport and giving you the key and that's it. At this point you have no choice. And just like that your night got 30% more expensive. Taking advantage of backpackers is not a good look for an hostel. 
Room was decent but bathroom smelled of sewage. 
The park in front got super shabby at night, with lots of homeless.
Also they promised free breakfast, but in the morning there was none. When I asked other guests in the kitchen they told me they had been waiting for the breakfast for a while.

i felt bad and not welcomed in this hostel,"kitchen was very dirty and the whole accommodation in total not very clean. was given an used towel (brown traces and full of hair). staff impolite, ignorant and arrogant. 
also was very frightened when (the owner?) wanted to know my whole creditcard details including the XXX verifying no. of course i locked out my credit card afterwards immediately through online banking. really bad i was forced to do that. and one other thing i do not want to mention here.

Pleasant,The atmosphere at the hostel was hostile - the staff was unfriendly and unaccommodating. Seems like Toronto doe snot understand what hostels are all about. There were no activities of any kind. I understand that after night time is quiet time but that does not warrant the hostel putting up huge hostile signs asking people to stop drinking exactly at 11 pm or to leave.

Acceptable for a quick stay. Affordable considering it's Toronto.,"The drapes that are used for privacy on the beds are useless. Lights seeks through & people peep at you in your bed. Some are broken. Need better quality pins to prevent gaps and light seeking through.

The lockers need to be able to accommodate at least a computer. I'd also look into selling locks because new clients, especially those here for short stays, may not have one on them.

There needs to be a quiet area for people to work. I understand the staff has to show people around. But trying to work at night was painful.  The staffer was very polite however, he was so loud and kept coming in the room when he could have pointed to the client where each area where. Instead, he kept disrupting the peace and making me lose my focus. 

There is garbage on the front grass. I understand that it's accessible by a lot of people, but do look into cleaning it once in a while. Which brings me to another point: clients should be aware that there is a camping site of homeless people right in front. An entire park of tents. It's very interesting at night...

In front, there is no sign with the name of the place. If there is, which I don't believe, it's not big enough to be seen on the sidewalk, from both sides. I also don't understand why clients can't buzz in to enter the front entrance door. New clients don't know the password and need other people's help. And if someone forgets their key at night, they are stuck outside.","Price is awesome!! Bed was very clean. Bathroom works. I love the different areas. I'd look into expanding the building.

the staff is also clueless about the room, they didn’t know where to turn the heating on or off, they didn’t know if there was a hairdryer although they said there should be one, the lighting switch wasn’t working properly, nor was the tv remote! and when we asked to change rooms they had the audacity of saying we were in one of their best 🤣",the location was great! nearby all the touristic places of the city,5.0,May 2022,"May 27, 2022",Queen Room,4,Couple,7.7

Another person in the room made phone call at 5:30 am speaking loudly. She was a long term resident and should have known to be considerate of those sleeping so early. staff just shrug this off justifying it as acceptable dorm activity. The hostel posts strict rules in regards to the kitchen as that affects them but don't care what goes on in the dorms as that only affects other guests. Guests expect others in a shared room to respect that it is a shared room. If they want to behave like they are in a private room than they should get a private room not expect the other guests to put up with bad behavour and justify it because it is a dorm.

Illegal workers that haven't passed the Health and Safety Exam from Ontario,"- I have stayed in this place for a couple of weeks now; the service and the maid service is not that bad (although I am not sure if the help are allowed to work in this country); they get to stay for free if they clean the place.

- There are many other people that cannnot sleep because of this. I personally spoke with them but most people hate to complain.

- The staff get irritated if you complain; they are who get loud and this is only because once they start arguing with you; they can ask you to leave; if the police come , the police is just supposed ""keep the peace"" and they won't mediate ; people just have to leave on the word of the ""attendant"" ; 
- once you have a dispute going on , Booking.com doesn't let you to post a review.

"If I could do everything but sleep here, it would be perfect...","There was no air conditioning in the room (on booking.com it states that there is). Instead, there were a few fans on in the room, which didn't make the room any cooler. The air in the room felt quite stuffy and it didn't always smell so great. 
The room wasn't small, but it didn't feel like there was much space, particularly for storage of bags and personal items.","Staff were really great, helpful and friendly. Location is very good, close to many attractions and not far from but and metro stops.

In the process, I lost my phone charger. I emailed the hostel twice if they had found it or not, but no reply at all.

Suffocating room and indecent staff.,"The staff is very unfriendly. I had a very bad experience with the front desk guy. On my checkout day, I was getting ready in my female only dorm room and I was an hour late than the usual checkout time(11am). So this front desk guy without knocking the door just used his keys and entered the FEMALY ONLY room without any intimation. He just walked upto my bed without permission. When I complained about this to the other female colleague of his then she just shrugged this off. I understand I was late and I had informed the cleaning lady which came to room at 10am but it is highly unacceptable that a guy is randomly coming to female dorms. I have been travelling from 5 years and lived in many hostels around europe but this never ever happened. Everybody adjusts for an hour or so. He even charged me extra money just for an hour which is still ok but how is it acceptable to enter the rooms?

Not the best.,"A few things actually:

I didn't like that the main building was different from the one I was staying at. I had to go out to go to the main building to access the kitchen.

I think I was left with a used toilet paper roll. It didn't look full or new during my stay. In addition, it would've been nice to have a floor mat outside the shower stall.

It smelled like old coffee when you get inside the building and I thought I smelled weed once I opened my room.","Convenient location to Chinatown and Union station, as well as areas different restaurants and retail stores.",6.0,October 2021,"October 5, 2021",Bed in 4-Bed Female Dormitory Room,1,Solo traveler,7.7
