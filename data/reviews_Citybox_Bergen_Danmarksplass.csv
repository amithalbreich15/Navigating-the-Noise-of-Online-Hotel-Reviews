Excellent value for money,"If being 2km from the centre is going to bother you, don’t book this hotel. It’s cheaper than other options for a reason! It’s silly to book a cheaper hotel and then complain about the exact reasons why it’s cheaper than the alternatives, as a lot of the other reviews are doing.","Decent size single room at a very reasonable price. 2km from the centre, but a very pleasant 20 minute walk in - and also right next to the tram with a direct line to the centre in about 10 minutes.

Wonderful,"The hotel itself is great, only the surrounding area didn’t have many restaurants or cafes (or anything else worth visiting, actually) so I’d probably look for a place closer to the city centre next time. However, the centre is only a 25-30 minute walk or a few tram stations away so it was ok.","Very nice and clean hotel, check-in was very quick and easy and the bed was super comfortable. Would definitely recommend Citybox.",9.0,July 2024,"July 25, 2024",Double Room,2,Solo traveler,8.4

"A great, practical place to explore Bergen","I’d describe it as “practical”. Apparently my room was upgraded but I couldn’t tell, it left me wondering how small/lacking the more basic rooms are.

The rooms also lack some of the usual hotel facilities like a kettle.","Great location near to tram line, local busses and some wonderful hiking up the hill immediately beside the hotel.

"Modern, young feel","Breakfast was not included but we paid one day for it, it cost 165NOK. It was very very simple but good enough for the price. Only had black coffee, missed some cappuccino, for instance.
Also, the only place where we could put our stuff on top was on the bench next to the window or the table. They were both behind a big curtain that we had to open in order to get our stuff, letting the light in and also it was possible to see us from the street. I would love to have some kind of desk or such that didn't require me to open the curtains all the time.
Another thing is regarding the location, it is convenient indeed but I would prefer to stay more in the city center if the price for the stay were not so different.","I had stayed in the Citybox in Oslo before, I like the idea.
Very modern feel to it, with automatic check-in, a place that feels made to young people.
Conveniently located next to the tram stop, even though not exactly in the city center. Very fast to arrive to city center and even possible to walk, even though we didn´t. Also it is the same tram line that goes to the airport, that was very convenient as well. 
Room that we had was big with very comfortable bed, nice big window facing the street.
It was good value for money, considering the prices of stay in Bergen city center are very high.
There was a vending machine and a little kitchen in the common area were it was possible to grab or prepare a quick bite.",9.0,July 2024,"July 10, 2024",Double Room,2,Couple,8.4

Recommend for staying,"No opportunity to open the window, fresh air is very important, specially in small places.","It is pretty modern and well-designed hotel. The room is small, but smartly organised. We liked the windowsill for sitting in our room. Great solution with „plastic” carpet instead of regular one which is hard to clean! The room was clean with a comfortable bed. It is a little bit far from the downtown, but a great distance for walking.",9.0,June 2024,"July 9, 2024",Small Double Room,1,Couple,8.4

Nice hotel with helpful facilities. Recommended!,"The room was very small, almost too small for 2 persons.

We enjoyed our stay at Citybox Danmarksplass.

Basic but comfortable,"Rooms are small
25min walk out of town (but public transport close by)
We ran out of toilet paper which was in one of those locked cases which made it hard to see (as it was black) when we visited the host no one was there (we went in the afternoon) several other guests were also waiting for the host. We waited a while and then had to just get the paper towels in the kitchen as we didn’t want to wait any longer. We stayed in other apartment hotels in Norway and they had a utilities storage locker which had extra essentials which you used the room code to open, this might be a good option for guest to grab so no need to find the host.","Clean

Nice modern hotel,"The minimal equipment in the room (2 big towels and 1 little for 2 people for instance or just one toilet paper), you can ask for more at the reception but that can quickly be annoying if you have a longer stay.","The location is very good, not too far from the centre (30m by foot and less than that if you take the tramway which is just next to the hotel) and with a good view on the mountains. Really appreciated the window view for this reason especially at this season where the sun never really fully goes down.

Price is reasonable for Bergen with a comfy room and bathroom and a very practical common area (though you can't really cook there the microwave and coffee machine were a big plus) 

Self check-in and out (+luggage storage) on the borns is very practical and easy. You can still have direct contact with someone if you wish to or have a problem.

"A great, well-priced hotel that was comfortable and perfect for our stay","The lack of shower curtain around the stand-up shower was not a big issue, but it did lead to the bathroom getting quite wet which required a bit of drying up after.","We had a fantastic two-night stay at Citybox Danmarksplass. Everything was clean, tidy and well organised. The bed was comfortable and the WiFi was fast. We had access to what we needed and expected with the opportunity to have some food items stored in the shared-fridge was fantastic. 

The location was great for what we were in Bergen for and there was easy access to the Bybanen for getting to the sentrum and the airport. Grocery stores are nearby, so it was quick to grab any food that was needed within minutes.

I would stay here again.,"some few spots on the floor, and it is probably difficult to clean. But easily avoidable by bringing some indoor shoes or using socks while traversing the room. I originally booked the other hotel and it is located more central in the city, it is also a citybox, but because of a misunderstanding from them, I got gravely accused of being someone else and apparently was banned from that place. And when I denied this, they did not believe me, continued with the same accusations and the day after I received a simple apology and in my honest opinion that is simply not good enough. I would expect some form of compensation like at least a discount even for some percent. So don't go for that one if possible, just an honest advice. you can anyway easily reach the city center by a train/tram Wich goes very often, only in 10 minutes.","Efficient staff, helpful, knowledgeable and easy communication. Cheap and good coffee from the machine downstairs. No TV, so if entertainment is an issue bring a laptop. Shower is nice pressure and good space. Not many sounds are heard trough the walls, or from the hallway. Elevator is knowledgeable about what floor you are at. Bed is super comfy with 4 pillows in the double bed, thumbs up. From the lobby you can enter a nice restaurant named Jaja, and that's recommended to at least try once. Keep it up and don't take the compliment as a means to double down on anything.

Pleasant and Affordable Stay in Norway,"If you use the shower for somewhat longer, it ""floods over"", but it wasn’t too bad once we put a towel on the floor. I would have appreciated some shampoo as well - only soap and shower gel were available. A small coffee machine with a couple of capsules in the room and a bottle of water for arriving guests would go a long way.
There was a snacks and coffee automats in the hall though (on the ground floor), but I’d be dubious getting a coffee from a machine that also offers soup as an option. :)","Rather small, but modern, clean and nicely set up room with a comfortable bed. The location is also good - 5 min to the tram stop (the same tram also goes to the airport in case you fly to/from Bergen, so it is very convenient) and ~25 min walk from the city center. 
The price is also very reasonable for what it offers, considering the accommodation prices in Norway and in Bergen specifically.
I also liked their transparency, making it clear that the rooms would not be cleaned every day due to sustainability reasons, as well as to keep the prices low. The heated floor in the bathroom should be a blessing with colder temperatures (we were quite lucky with the weather in September though). 
The number of towels is limited for the same reasons, but you can request more of these for free.",9.0,September 2023,"September 10, 2023",Double Room,2,Couple,8.4

Yes there is nothing the room, no electric kettle and side things, but a very very comfortable bed is equipped, wifi works perfect, the bathroom is big enough, clean, even a couch-like sitting place is by the window. Check-in/out process is totally automatic and easy. A restaurant is in the lobby, warm atmosphere, and if you need truly a help there is somebody always for help.

A little overpriced,"That there's not enough lighting in the room. You only get 2 towels for one person (shower and hand towel). At least 3 are needed, one for the bathroom floor since the shower glass does not go all the way down to the floor and water splashes out the shower easily. 
They claim as not having tv to keep the prices low where that's ok, but is not only no TV. There's no fridge/mini bar, no safe, no breakfast (you have to go to adjecent restaurant JAJA) no housekeeping until checkout. A lot of savings for what the rate a night is.
Again, this can be ok for short stay but anything over 2 nights, I think they should do the room every other day.","The beds are comfortable and the rooms are pretty clean. I also love the fact that there is a laundry room but the iron board is dirty.

I think your concept of the Citybox is great: reducing costs by not having TV in all your rooms and no minibar or something like that, but I would like to have at least a small fridge in the room, than sharing the one downstairs. That is because that it does not seems like the fridge is checked daily to she who has checked out and then left their belongings in there for you to through, which makes the fridge to smell if left there for long time.

The hotel was at 30 min walk from the city center but well conected by public transport. I liked it was near car rentals and a bay where you could swim and a flosting sauna (next to moxy hotel). The best thing was it has a small kitchen with fridge and microwave, and also a couple of supermarkets very close by. I also like they had a restaurant there, although i did not try it.

Optimal location to visit the city,"Citibox is actually a basic hotel, what its name says. Maybe we've expected a bit more. No TV in the room, no safe, no teapot and no refrigerator. Instead of it you have a proxy kitchen on the ground floor and it can be pretty full sometimes. There you find a microwave, teapot, shared fridge etc. There are lockers and baggage room for additional cost. The mattress on the bed is soft and comfy but the pillows are hard, it should be matched together. We stayed here 4 nights and didn't get even one room service, your room get full of waste quite fast, this is the reason for overall score reduction. The breakfast is really poor, not worth the price one pay, don't take it. Kind of bad idea to activate the elevator with the room card if you're carrying a coffee or a hot teacup from the kitchenette.","The hotel is almost new and modern. The self-check-in desk worked fine for us, and we liked it. The light rail stop is behind the corner and it’s easy to reach the city. You have two supermarkets around, a bakery and a fast food local.

Ok but not the best location,Small room is way too small. I stayed first in a normal size room and it was a huge difference. The small one is maybe good for one night or just one person but not for a couple. You can barely walk in the room as all furniture is close together. The double bed has only access on one side of the bed. I actually didn’t really notice that I had booked such small room until I got in. So pay attention when you book. The location is not terrible but there’s nothing to see or do around the hotel. Plus it’s a 20 to 30 min walk to the city center or 15min with the tram.,Helpful staff.

"very good option for a short stay, close to the airport and easy to get to the city center from","I found that the room was missing kind of basics amenities like a small rug in the bathroom or slippers, to provide a very standard level of comfort. Very basic room facilites, and even thought there were only three lamps in my room, one of them was not working. Breakfast was good, but starting at 7am it was almost too late for business travellers, you need to start earlier, so this hotel is a great option for one or two nights, but I would not recommend it for a longer period of time","very good if you will be using the room for one or two nights, knowing that you will get just the bare level of comfort.

"Our stay was fine, but..","The self-service check-in didn't go so well. At that moment there was nobody to assist us, sometimes there is back-up personnel we later on experienced. When we finally checked-in, we didn't know our room number. We finally got it when someone was available. The parking instructions were unclear. When I finally found the parking garage, there were some squatters there sitting between the cars using drugs. Not a great place to leave your car for a couple of days and definitely not at that rate (I believe 160 NOK per 24 hours). The room was small and there was no servicing during our stay. I understand that this is part of the concept, but the 'keeping prices low' part didn't really work.","In general our stay was fine, we had a good time exploring Bergen.

Very easy to find, uncomplicated check-in, staff available all the time if you need help, very welcome and lively place, but also quiet, if you need to relax and enjoy your privacy. Everything very clean, simple but nice and comfortable room (ours had a view of a nearby mountain and a big supermarket Extra just opposite the hotel - open every day). There is cleaning only if you pay extra but this didn't bother us during our 3-night stay at all. Extra towels are available at the reception if needed, we asked for a water kettle and could keep it during the whole stay. There is a restaurant where you can have breakfast/lunch/dinner, but we didn't use it. Exploring Bergen, we very much recommend walking up Floyen Mountain and hiking around and also going to Mount Ulriken (we took the cable car).

There you have everything you need in one place, from restaurants, bars, clubs, a lot of different food, also we have a fish  marked in town for those ho really want to taste the Norwegian fish strait from the sea her. In town there is also lot of different museums for those ho like that, go also and see old churches around in city. I also recommend everyone to see old Bergen where all those colourful houses by the sea are, from there you can take Fløyenbanen up or you can decide to walk up, from there you can see all Bergen town in one picture 🥰🌸🇳🇴 I will also recommend to walk in Sandviken and Nordnes parken there you can get a feeling of walking between all the smal cozy houses and streets in Bergen.

We had found Scandinavia quite expensive so tried to economise with our accommodation in Bergen.

Terrible,"A big disappointment. The area was not very nice. The small room, with hair on the sheets. There was no shampoo in the bathroom. There was no cleaning service, so the room was dirty during the stay. The frightening sight. And I had requested late check-out, they answered yes and that it would be free. I confirmed it with the only person on staff the day before I checked out, and they still charged me extra afterwards, which was a ""bot error"". It is a hotel where you hardly have to deal with humans, you have to do everything on your own.","The boy with whom I had to argue when they wanted to charge me for the late check out. He was very kind and he apologized multiple times for the mistake.

terrible and yucky experience!!!,I stayed here last night and had a terrible experience! I had unpacked my things and was preparing to shower when I saw how dirty and yucky the toilet bowl!!! I dont know if it was a vomit or… just the thought of it makes me feel very uncomfortable!!! I called the receptionist and complained! there was no cleaner at night so I had no choice but to move to another room! I had to packed my things again! a complete stress! the night shift lady was apologetic. I tried to complain to the day shift now before checking out. He was not apologetic!!

"Minimalistic hotel for a very decent price. Very convenient location, but very simplified service","I was very tired when arriving at the hotel around midnight a Saturday night, after travelling from central Europe. I was taking the tram (Bybanen) directly from the airport, and it became really packed with young people as we got closer to the city center. This has nothing to do with the hotel - but I will NEVER again take the tram to the city on a late saturday eve.
My main point is about the digitalization at this hotel. I think it is a failure, and shows that digitalization might go wrong.
Arriving at the hotel and checking in was NOT easy. The door was closed, and there was a sign that I should use the doorbell behind me. I did, and a young lady came promptly and let me in. My first thougt was, if there is staff present around the clock - why not staff a reseption desk?
The self-service check-in computer was impossible to miss. I had my code ready, and started the registration. It all went fast, but my room number was displayed in 3 seconds, than disappeard and the check-in computer spitted out a card with no room number, I could read a message that a welcome email was sent to me. I was so tired that I did not notice the room number. I cheked my inbox, but no email had arrived. I waited a minute, and checked again - still no email. 
I went around the corner, and found an office with two persons from the hotel staff. They were very friendly, and solved my problem in few seconds, handing me a paper with the room number.
So I asked myself again - why not have a reception desk, where a friendly human being receives you, give you a smile, and help you to check-in and give you a key and the room number. This approach has been used in hotels for hundreds of years, and there is NO NEED to change that, when you are paying staff to be present anyway.
I moved up to my room, which was quiet, clean, modern and new. But it was very simple - no wardrobe or shelfs, but just naked walls. No TV (!), and a very small bathroom. 
""What you pay is what you get"".","The hotel is located not in, but close to the city center. Only 2 minutes walk from the tram (""Bybanen""), 3-4 stops from the Bergen city center.  Even if it was close to the busy traffic junction Danmarksplass, the room was surprisingly quiet, and made it possible to have a good nights sleep!",5.0,October 2023,"October 24, 2023",Small Double Room,1,Solo traveler,8.4

Affordable bt no fun in an awful aurrounding,"Area of Hotel is a mess. Lookout is horrible.
Hotel is in second row to major E39 road.
The hotel is a typical heartless storage room for backback travellers. No checkin with a human (if only the chekin terminals would work).
No TV, No Fridge, 
No breakfast, but you can have breakfast in the (external-haha) restaurant in the lobby  for 155 NOK extra.
We didn't because I visited their toilets and as the say ""see the toilets and you know the kitchen"" - we quit.
Suggest excellent Baker Brun on the other side of the road.

Found this hotel to be ""gimmicky"" in that they are trying to create a hotel that requires the least amount of human contact as possible. The check in is supposedly automated and must ask (or take additional steps) to get human help. This has untended consequences like when guest gets off a bus and calls to get walking directions to the hotel from bus terminal (had to search for human & got poor directions rather than help.) Room door & elevator requires scan of automated key card, the key reader often could not recognize card = delays = time waste. No closet or hangers (only a few hooks on wall.)
