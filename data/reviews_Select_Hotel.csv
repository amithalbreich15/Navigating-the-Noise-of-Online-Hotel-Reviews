Everything was amazing except a very minor weird situation,"For some reason, even if you put ""do not disturb"" notice on the door, people who are working in hotel just knock the door couple of times and then open it if you don't answer. Maybe something got mixed up on their end because as soon as they saw me, they apologized. I have stayed 6 nights, and it happened twice to me.","From staff to location to the restaurant they are ordering meals, everything is amazing. I cannot suggest any better place for this price range.

The scenery was amazing, everyone was really helpful. They are asking to clean (vacuum cleaning) the room everyday and they change all the sheets, towels etc every 3 days.

The restaurant just next to it has amazing food. Hotel has an agreement with them so if you order food, it will come from the same restaurant.",10,October 2022,"October 15, 2022",Executive Double Room,6,Couple,9

"Fantastic 3 night stay during the Olympics, will definitely be back to this hotel.",Everything was excellent,"This hotel is an excellent choice in the beautiful Saint Germain area of Paris and just on the doorstep of Jardin du Luxembourg.

The staff were incredibly helpful and always had smiles on their faces. 
Lots of fabulous places to eat and grab drinks nearby.

We had a wonderful stay and will definitely return on our next trip to Paris.,"Well, this is because we are crazy Americans, but we always love being able to workout at a hotel gym if it is available. I understand that this is not possible and we certainly walked the city enough during our stay. Because of the time difference, it took our bodies a few days to adjust. Can I suggest maybe offering some snacks available for purchase beyond what is in the refrigerator when people wake in the middle of the night hoping for some breakfast? Maybe some bread, butter, fruit, yogurt? Just an idea. Honestly we did fine without it. Or maybe suggest a quick trip to the monoprix down the road, just to stock up in case?","The location is unbeatable. We loved being in an area with restaurants, shops, and no cars, and such a short walk to the Jardin du Luxembourg. It was a perfect hotel for us, with our young children. The rooms were lovely, and the bathrooms were great. I love the soap and lotion that they use and hope to order some for myself when I return home! The staff are incredibly kind.

"Comfortable, clean, quiet, great location, lovely staff","We liked this hotel very much, but travelers should be aware of one issue that might make some people uncomfortable: there is no bathroom door so there is no privacy while taking a shower or bath. In other words, the tub/shower is completely visible to the rest of the room. (The toilet is behind a door.) This was not clear in the booking information. We booked a “Standard Double Room with Winter Garden View” and the bathroom was described as including an “Italian shower” which is not accurate.","The staff were all friendly and helpful.

Although this isn’t the hotels fault they did fail to let us know before arrival and we didn’t find out until departure. However, the staff were very understanding and explained that this increase is due to the Olympics coming in the summer and the mayor increasing rates for all. They did say they would look into this and see if they could provide a room discount once they have spoken to the manager, so we have paid the bill not knowing if they will honour this or not, I guess we will need to wait and see but no one has got in touch as yet.",The staff were very friendly and accommodating,10,March 2024,"March 28, 2024",Standard Double Room with Winter Garden View,3,Family,9

Good,The door does not provide soundproofing so you will hear everything from the hall although this is not a big issue as there was only one other room on the floor.  I did not like having a key to the door instead of a keycard this feels outdated. The walls could use a good cleaning as they were very marked up and the bathroom walls were very dirty with brown spots.,The location is great and it is very nice to be so close to the Luxembourg Gardens. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room size was good for just myself but I would not want to stay with another person.

Poor,I made this booking for my 18 year old daughter and her friend for a stay in Paris post A levels. First time in Paris. I made an error and booked for 2 nights leaving 11th instead of including 11th. They woke the girls up and told them they had to leave the hotel as check out was 11. They thought they had another night. They were happy to pay an extra night. But the hotel just told them to leave. I personally think they should have either found them a room or found a room in another hotel. You can’t send 2 18 year olds out in the street like that. So I cannot recommend this hotel as the staff were very unpleasant in this situation. They really didn’t care what happened to the girls. These are polite London private school girls who would not have been rude.,The decor was nice. The location was safe.,3.0,July 2022,"July 11, 2022",Small Double Room with Winter Garden View,2,Group,9

Lots of wonderful things about the hotel.,"The toilets in the rooms, are around the corner from your bathroom. To open and close the door on the toilet door you had to use ‘pocket handles’ on the door and push in on them to open it up. It isn’t very sanitary to have to use the toilet then open the door and shut the door to go around the corner to wash your hands. The toilet was the one area of the room that didn’t look very clean, either (smudges on wall). Just a bit bizarre!","The location on Place Sorbonne was wonderful. tucked off the street on a square with dining options, and the Metro an easy walk away (Luxembourg) which is a straight shot to Gare du Nord if you come into Paris by train. Bathroom shower had great water pressure and was a nice rain shower head. fridge in the room and comfortable bed. The staff was very friendly. umbrellas to use for rainy days were appreciated.",8.0,July 2022,"July 30, 2022",Executive Double Room,3,Family,9
Cozy hotel in a good location,The toilet in the room was separate and there was no possibility of hand washing and there was no bidet.  The towel drying was a bit difficult because the towel rack is very narrow.,"The location of the hotel is good.  Close to bus stops and metro station.  The hotel is a sympathetic mix of the new and the old.  The hotel has everything you need.  The price-quality ratio is in place.  The staff is really helpful and friendly. 

Breakfast was tasty and good.  Scrambled eggs, oven vegetables, bacon and chicken fillet and beans were served as a hot dish.  Various breads, yoghurts, cold cuts.  Of course coffee, tea and fresh juices.  etc. We went to breakfast at about 8 o'clock, and it was not busy.

The room was good, quite small as usual in Paris hotels.  The bed was good for sleeping.  The room was cleaned every day.  Overall, the atmosphere was cozy.  I can warmly recommend the hotel.",8.0,April 2022,"April 9, 2022",Executive Double Room,4,Couple,9
