# Navigating-the-Noise-of-Online-Hotel-Reviews
When planning a vacation and searching for accommodations, many of us turn to read user reviews on websites like booking.com, sifting through thousands of reviews. But how meaningful are these reviews? And what can we conclude from so many contradicting reviews?

Online hotel reviews have been the focus of research across various disciplines, including their
impact on consumers choice and hotel performance, text analysis and summarization of reviews,
and the motivations behind leaving reviews. Using multiple topics covered during the course,
this works presents the topic-indicativeness scores (3.1), a metric that provides nuanced and
semantically rich summary of user reviews; Then, we will show how this metric can be used in
order to rerank hotels to improve recommendations based on user preferences (3.2), and to
extract concise but meaningful insights from a large amount of reviews (3.3).
