Warm welcome and privacy are highly appreciated! I can wait to be back!,"The location was a little bit off for me, but not the hostel's fault. It's a bit weird to walk around, but I must say it was very convenient being able to walk (during the day) to the Bean and Millennium Park.","I really loved the curtains to each bunk bed! I value privacy and this was a very good surprise! I've stayed in other locations of HI USA Hostels and Chicago was a great surprise also with the shared spaces and nice breakfast!

"Great location, friendly staff","Size of the room was quite small and felt a bit cramped with a 6 yr old child who wanted to play in a morning before breakfast, nowhere to store suitcases etc so they took up most of the floor space","Loved the location for access to the museums etc, food and recreation area was fab",9.0,July 2024,"August 19, 2024",Twin Over Full Bunk Bedroom,3,Family,8.3,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
"Overall, a great stay and would definitely stay again.",Only complaint is the lack of bathrooms. Not enough and also the shower is in the same room as the only toilet in the dorm area so you can’t use it if someone is in the shower.,Great location!

"Surprising welcome, I would stay there again","* The room was so cold and I could barely sleep on the first night - and talking with women in other rooms, I heard the same complain. But I asked for an extra blanket at the reception and they promptly gave me one, solving the problem.
* Before arriving, I had inquired if I could send something to be delivered to the hostel. They said yes, but only when I was retrieving the package I found that I had to pay a fee (US$3) for this. Maybe I overlooked this information in the rules, but anyway, I was sad that they did not inform me of the fee when I asked about the possibility of sending a delivery.
* Not the hostel's fault, but someone ate my food! They have stickers where you are supposed to put your name and check-in/out date before storing any food in the kitchen - what I found was great! so imagine my surprise when I arrived one night almost all my cereal and milk were gone.
     - side note: the kitchen was a mess! I understand that it was the guests' responsibility to clean their dishes, but it looks like no one did and the sink was overflowing with dirty utensils","The room was huge, all the beds had privacy curtains, individual lights, and a locker big enough to store a piece of hand luggage. The bathroom had shampoo, conditioner, and soap. Each person has an individual card that opens their room, bathroom, and floor at the elevator - which I found gave me a feeling of safety. The hostel is near bus stops and metro stations, and you can walk to Millennium Park.",9.0,August 2024,"August 18, 2024",Bed in Women's 10-Bed Dorm,6,Solo traveler,8.3,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0

Perfect for a quick jaunt into Chicagoland,"Though I personally felt safe and never concerned, it you arrive at the hostel at night, there will likely be unhoused residents taking up shelter outside under the overhang of the building as you approach it for the night. More reason we need to work on social supports and affordable housing etc but just informing other solo travelers that they are there and you are safe.","I stayed here for a brief overnight. There were severe weather storms and tornados that impacted my travel home. I decided that instead of fighting it and staying at the airport, I might as well enjoy Chicago. So I took the train into town from the airport and was able to get here easy in less than an hour. Front desk staff were available 24/7, and they have very secure and clean facilities. They coordinate events around town, and the people who stay here are so kind, inclusive, and friendly. 

Delicious breakfast and ability to store luggage until your flight out made it very simple for me. I was able to return to the hostel and get right back on the train to the Airport with minimal strain. 

I think this is a great place, well worth it's money and easy to connect and make acquaintances to go explore the city with. (I was on a solo mission to get the energy of the town more than see the sights myself)

Thank you to the staff who helped me and kept me safe through multiple tornados and severe weather storms that hit town. Pretty cool trip.",9.0,July 2024,"August 11, 2024",Bed in Women's 4-Bed Dorm,1,Solo traveler,8.3,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Fantastic value for downtown Chicago! Really great hostel experience,"As any downtown area of a big city, the hostel surroundings get pretty sketchy at night.

Facilities are spacious, nicely decorated, with lots of common spaces. Felt safe with all the locks and security features.

Great location close to the big sights and transportation.,"Unlike my last visit, this time I had a room facing the train tracks next to the building (If my previous room was facing them, I've forgotten).  If the windows could be a little thicker to block out the noise, it'd be great.I quickly got used to the noise though and didn't need to use earplugs at all.","Quick check-in. The front desk loaned me a fan as well since my room felt pretty warm.
It's very quiet, even in the common areas.
The location is great.  Right next to the library, only about 20 mins walking from Union Station, 5-7 min. walk to the Art Institute and about 20-24 mins from the Field Museum.
If you want to take public transportation, there's the trains running next to the hostel and bus stops less than a block away as well.
It's a clean, no-frills kind of place.
I had a private double. In the room in addition to the bed, was a small wall desk and chair.  In a small alcove, there were extra sheets, towels and an ironing board with iron. I liked the tall windows and extra tall ceiling I had. Lots of natural light.
The bed was firm but still a little soft.  I had no trouble sleeping through the night.
I didn't take part in any of the group programs or tours offered or use the laundry room so I can't comment on those.
The breakfast is pretty basic.  Bagels, croissants, bread, oatmeal and cereals for the most part.  Nothing extravagant but good to get you going in the morning.
When I got there, one elevator was out of service and the button wouldn't stay lit when pressed so I thought the other elevator was down as well so I climbed the stairs to the 7th floor with my backpack on.

"Nice place, but serious hiccups","Lockers are inconveniently located inside sleeping areas. Since there is a secured common area for each block of rooms, lockers should be located in these common areas so that people don’t have to wake each other up while opening/closing/shuffling through their loud metal lockers. 
Also, their computer system is not secure. The hostel’s booking system was hacked and a credit card confirmation request was sent out to guests through the Booking.com system. Since the message came through the Booking platform, I clicked on it, let the auto fill input my credit card info, and clicked enter, but realized that the processing bar (and the wording of the request) were too suspicious and clicked out, but since I’d already entered my CC info, I had to cancel that credit card and have a new one issued.

This hostel is really nice for location it located in Chicago downtown with access to the public transportations, grocery stores, restaurants and cafés. It came with 7 floors building with modern interior design, it's a small apartment with two bedrooms, dining table, kitchen, shower and toilet also there's many facilities such microwave, hair dryer, tissues and towels. Reception staff is friendly, helpful and professional once the rooms are ready they let you check in early even if in the morning. The breakfast is good for the quality also for free and there's open kitchen if you want to make your own meals. Beds are good and always clean. The security system for the building is very good, that's why it's safe. There's a laundry room and washing machines at the 7 floor. The cost of accommodation is very reasonable compared to others hostels in such area. There's a dig setting hall at the second floor for internment and chilling.

overall a good clean place right in the loop,"There was a storm the evening of our arrival that knocked out the electricity to the pump for water and the ac. We were informed casually AFTER checkin and payment, and that it would be repaired in ‘40 minutes’. Well that was optimistic. The no ac would have been ok if they hadn’t bolted all the windowso completely shut. it was stifling. 
and in the morning there was still no water, and water bottles were locked up in an office. i had to demand water bottles for brushing teeth. toilets were essentially port-o-lets. it was gross. and it seemed there is a culture of ‘not my job’ as so many people were working, and no one filled some buckets with water from the ground floor to force flush anything. later, after 1pm, after the cleaning crew arrived, they were doing just that. no reason other team members didnt pitch in during the emergency situation. 
the new generator was being delivered at 2pm, a full 14 hours after that ‘40 minutes’. 
we did, however, get a full refund for the one-night stay. they would have saved 50% of that with some buckets and bottles of water.

Great Hostel .. Like the Renovations.,"l did not like all renovations:  They took down the closet space in the 4 bed room..lts more spacious now  but where do you hang your coat in fall or that nice dress?..(lockers have hooks..right..no!) 
They also used to have a desk or two in the room ..now only a sitting bench..ok no big deal its hard to share desk anyway.  Lastly, you arrive late at night and you will find towels and only a bed sheet in your bed...if you want a blanket ..you will have to go all the way down to reception to get it. This is a cost saving tactic..some people don't need a blanket..it saves on washing. 
The temperature in the room was fine in summer..but most folks may need a blanket..get one downstairs on your way up.

 If you a light sleeper you will be bothered by the hostels location right next to the elevetated train.  It is quiet noisy in the early morning.","I have been coming to this hostel for years..After covid l have been staying in private rooms..this time l shared a  ""premium"" 4 bed room in a suite..so up to 8 females share a bathroom (think dorm style) ..l was pleasantly surprised with the renovations.  The room was clean..new floors (no yucky carpet) and the bunk beds were new and sturdy no creaking..new curtains at each bed and night light. Most rooms have huge windows with easy to open/close blinds.

Breakfast is generous..hot oatmeal.. bread and pastries and hard boiled eggs(eggs mostly on weekdays not weekends.. l think)..cheese, butter and jam.. coffee and juice.  Of course you have access to fridges and use of a full kitchen.  I also liked that the international crowd is back!  Guest include  solo older travelers like myself,  youth groups and  families.  
Very nice hostel.. but remember.. Hostels are affordable because most rooms are shared or you share a bathroom...that is not for everyone..and your experience will vary depending if you and your roommates are nice and considerative of each other and the common space. I have had tons of great encounters...and a few bad ones.",8.0,May 2023,"May 19, 2023",Bed in Women's 4-Bed Dorm,1,Solo traveler,8.3,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1

The hostel used to have trash cans in the single rooms.. a single trash can and a recycling bin  in the common kitchen does not cut it.. really,!

Unfortunately, in the pandemic aftermath the hostel is still using disposable plates, cups and utensils... Staff  shortage may be part of it. Let's  hope the hostel returns to sustainability..reusable breakfast wear.","Finally!  l can say the hostel is pretty much back to normal since the covid pandemic! .l can see a return to a mix of travelers male and females  and they have activities for guests..
l travel for work on my own dime. I am a solo female traveler over 50.  l have been coming here now and then for over 10 years so l have seen the ups and downs .. Note this is a hostel not a hotel ..mainly, you will find just the basics bunk beds or double bed, towel,  chair and  table.. and mostly shared rooms or single rooms with shared bathroom depending on price. If sharing is ok with you ..this hostel is a great value in a great location and staff is nice.

Continental breakfast is great and includes pastries, bread,  cheese and oatmeal (hard boiled eggs are offered sometimes but not on weekends) l like to bring my own ham or fresh fruit to compliment what they offer. Premium suites include a common fridge or you can use the ones in the main kitchen.

The shared bathroom could have been cleaner - someone left dirty clothes and towels on the floor, which weren't cleaned up in two days.  The furniture was worn.  But we weren't expecting a luxury hotel.  This was fairly adequate for the price and location.  The breakfast was really basic (bagels, rolls, cream cheese, cereal, milk, orange juice, etc.).

"Overall amazing, will definitely use again","It is understandable that things can be out of service at times, but having the hot water machine break down during my stay (Nov) was not the best experience. Also, the laundry room for guests was out of service, which was pretty frustrating.

Another thing that could be better is having bigger lockers as the dorm rooms certainly have enough space. Still this is just something that would be nice to have, the lockers are pretty standard hostel size.","The location is great. A dorm room is definitely among the cheapest accomodations in the area and works perfectly. 

The dorms are more like little apartments, at least the 4 bed female dorms are. There is a little common room, 2 rooms with 4 beds each, a disabled kitchen (only microwave works) and there is a bathroom for the 8 beds, 2 sinks with mirrors (independent from bathroom).

The safety measures will make you for sure feel at ease. You have to use your room key to get into the building at night. You have to use your key to operate the elevators at all times. You have to use your room key to get into your dorm and to get into the room you have your bed in.

Public transportation is pretty easy to get to. There is police presence at all times, specially at night. You are where all the architecture tours will take you, literally you will walk around the hotel in some of them. 

Staff was very nice and accommodating. You can get blankets, extra towels and clean sheets anytime you ask for them on the check in counter.

Very Good,"Given this is the land of lawsuits, it's understandable that they have a liability waiver (though many smaller hostels I stayed in the States don't have it, guess they couldn't afford lawyers, unlike this one). It left a bad first impression nonetheless, as if you went to a restaurant and the first thing they served was a waiver for all food poisoning liabilities. And the way their staff handled it didn't help either. Their reply, when asked some questions, was basically it's what it's, take it or leave it. They lacked the common warm feeling in hospitality service, and were more like bureaucrats - polite enough in interactions, but grudgingly. Their price was comparable to most American hostels I stayed at but that also means it is more expensive than the global rate. Wifi signal in the kitchen area was fine but if your room is far from it then signal strength would drop significantly","I stayed in a dorm and, facilities wise, it was one of the best hostels I stayed at. It was a 10-bed dorm but it was clean and very spacious (other hostels would make it 16 bed).

Hi Chigoco Hostel Review - Nov 2023,Cons: The breakfast varieties is limited. Otherwise can't complain. All goes smoothly and nice.,"Pros: One of the awesome experiences I had ever with hostels. This hostel is really nice for location it located in Chicago downtown with access to the public transportations, grocery stores, restaurants and cafés. It came with 7 floors building with modern interior design, it's a small apartment with two bedrooms, dining table, kitchen, shower and toilet also there's many facilities such microwave, hair dryer, tissues and towels. Reception staff is friendly, helpful and professional once the rooms are ready they let you check in early even if in the morning. The breakfast is good for the quality also for free and there's open kitchen if you want to make your own meals. Beds are good and always clean. The security system for the building is very good, that's why it's safe. There's a laundry room and washing machines at the 7 floor. The cost of accommodation is very reasonable compared to others hostels in such area. There's a dig setting hall at the second floor for internment and chilling.

they limit your stay for two weeks so not sure why make people pay an $18 yearly membership in this hostel chain, is this a way to make more money for no valid reason (?) just add that to the overall room price, otherwise it makes it look like its cheaper than what it really is.

"Extra fee charged per night, not reflected in booking.com price.","The extra fee applied. HI Chicago is a property for members only apparently, if you are not a member you have to pay 4$ extra per night. That is very misleading since it is not reflected in the price before booking. I only came to know about it after booking my stay and receiving an email from the hostel. In my opinion this is not an honest policy and the reason I wouldn't recommend staying at this hostel. This should be clearly stated before booking and factored in the demonstrated price. After the booking is made, it is too late to inform the customer, since there are not really many practical choices on the customers side. Either the customer has to agree and pay the fee, which is an arbitrary amount and there is no guarantee that it will be low. The other option is to cancel the booking which will cost the customer an amount close to one night's stay, that can be a significant amount for some budgets. Please consider removing this fee or explicitly informing anyone interested up front. In my opinion it is a very insincere practice to obscure costs from the customers.","Facilities, location, clean state, security inside the building.",7.0,June 2022,"July 1, 2022",Bed in Men's 8-Bed Dorm Ensuite,1,Solo traveler,8.3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

activities offered: so many options for everyone and ways to bring the guests together
breakfast: was simple, offered enough that you could fill up and feel satiated, but I would say it gets old rather quickly as theres not much variety
room: LOVE the blackout blind, thats a great touch. The only downsides were that the ac was blasting over top of my bed 24/7 and I was freezing. But they did give me a second blanket so that was very kind. 
The other suggestion I have would be to install a small wooden shelf or something between the base of the top bunk and the wall as when your upstairs bunk neighbor turns their light on at 1 am, it brightens up the bottom bunk as if its day time. The other reason for this is the person above me kept dropping their phone down the crack in the middle of the night and once it smacked me straight in the face. A barrier in this space would save many headaches for all lower bunk guests!

You have to have a active key card to get into the building, to take the elevator, to use the bathroom and so on. Not only that but the shared living space even felt safe. You have to use a key to get int he shared living area and a key to get in to your private room. So, I really thought it was really safe and really cool place to experience the cultures of people that stay here. they also have this common area which is a really cool place to be around other people. The front desk was super nice and they even let us hold our bags after check out. Overall I loved the experience and definitely plan on recommending this place to everyone and staying here again. It was a really cool experience and different from places I usually stay at. It was a great  experience. I have stayed at a lot if places this is my new favorite great vibes!

Exceptional,"Due to the location being in downtown there are a lot of sirens at random hours of the night and the building is right next to the raised L-train tracks so if you're a light sleeper then maybe bring some earplugs or headphones, it didn't personally bother me but I know it might bother some people. Also due to it being downtown there are a few homeless people who roam around along that street, the hostel does a very good job of keeping them away from and outside of the hostel but if you aren't prepared the homeless people in Chicago are some of the most aggressive panhandlers I've ever encountered in my trips across the US(this isn't really the hostels problem more of a warning to people staying there, the area is extremely safe but just stay aware). Also a small warning since I recommend public transit due to it being so developed and close to the hostel, be mindful that due to COVID-19 there are driver shortages so the buses/trains might be delayed more specifically the buses are effected by this so be mindful.","It was a nice place to stay there were pretty extensive safety measures. Such as, you had to keycard swipe to even get to the elevator hallway then once in the elevators you have to swipe your card again to select your floor and once you get to your room you have to swipe to enter the room. Also after hours they lock the side doors and you have to enter in through the main door which also is keycard protected and if you don't have a keycard you have to be buzzed in through the speaker. It made me feel very safe considering I was traveling alone, I visited a friends hotel in Chicago and walked straight up to her room and no one stopped or questioned me. The full service kitchen is pretty nice but due to COVID-19 the utensils/plates are disposable and you have to bring your own pots/pans/cooking utensils so keep that in mind. You do have to request a blanket at the front desk but you can do so at any point in your trip. The lockers are also larger than I expected I was able to fit a medium sized suitcase and my backpack in it and I still had some wiggle room. Don't forget to bring your own lock for the lockers.

Also due to it's location downtown right next to the raised L-train tracks, it is within walking distance to a lot of cool stores, tourist places, restaurants, and if you don't feel like walking far the bus stops and boarding stations for the L train are all within a 3-4 minute walk of the front door. I recommend downloading the transit apps(I think one is just called transit and the other in ventra)/using google maps and then buying day passes for the public transit because it'll give you unlimited rides on buses/trains for however many days you choose.",10.0,January 2022,"February 3, 2022",Bed in Women's 8-Bed Dorm Ensuite,9,Solo traveler,8.3,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1

Just make sure to bring socks and warm clothes if you're staying here in the winter, just in case!","This was the PERFECT hostel for a weekend in Chicago with my boyfriend. We spent 3 nights here and are so glad we did! We stayed in a private room, and it was very spacious with a closet and hangers. The bathroom was right down the hall and had shampoo, conditioner, soap AND towels. This place had the best location EVER to walk anywhere or take a bus/train to any of the museums. The beds and pillows were comfy, the rooms were quiet (besides the trains outside). Nothing that earplugs couldn't fix though! All the staff were friendly. The hostel felt secure and safe, and you get a keycard to unlock every room. This hostel had a nice and cozy vibe here and was the perfect place to hang, play pool or ping pong! They also offer free coffee and granola bars in the morning, which was a really nice touch. They also have a lot of vending machines as well. There are also lockers/storage (free of charge) while you walk around the city! Just make sure to bring your own lock to lock the lockers. You really get the best bang for your buck here!

I felt unsafe during my stay.,"I recently stayed at HI Chicago and unfortunately had a concerning experience regarding security, particularly for women. During my last night there, a man continuously knocked on the door of my female-only dorm room. Despite another female guest answering the door, explaining that it was a female dorm, the man persisted, claiming the room was his. He appeared intoxicated and made himself at home without removing his shoes.

This incident occurred late at night, leaving me feeling extremely vulnerable and unsafe. I was worried about the possibility of assault, not just for myself but for other female guests as well. Thankfully, another guest sought help from the lobby staff, who eventually removed the intruder from the room. However, the lack of communication from the staff about the situation only added to our distress.

As a result of this experience, I cannot in good conscience recommend HI to anyone, especially women. It's imperative that the security system at HI, particularly in female dormitories, be improved to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Blanket provided was made of sticky plastic/Styrofoam. Bathroom was not clean, room (floor) was only cleaned on request.

There is also a weird smell inside the building, and no fresh air coming into the rooms (only one window in the room I stayed in).
They overcharged me for the hostel membership as it's $4/night or $18/year. No one explained that so I ended up paying $24 for the 6 nights that I stayed. Compared to other hostels this is overpriced, compared to hotels in Chicago this is the only cheap option. 
You also have to lock up all your stuff into tiny lockers so that nothing gets stolen and they don't provide any locks for use/rent so you have to buy one.","The only reason I stayed here is because of the price and the location.

The WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have EVER experienced.,"Long story short, they were totally unable to work together with me as a customer to provide a reliable solution for a mistake that was both sides' fault.

I booked a bed in a shared room to stay during my trip for a Coldplay concert in Chicago, I received the confirmation of the booking almost a week before. I was so excited that I did not pay attention to the details on it and that was my biggest mistake. The day I arrived, right there at the counter waiting to check in I noticed that the booking says ""Male shared room"" so I told the front desk guy and he immediately told me that that was a big mistake from my side and that they were fully booked. the thing was that they only offered separate rooms for females and males and there was no more female room available to change me, so his only solution was to give a refund. I told him that for me it was not a problem to stay in a male room as most of the hostels around the world that I had stayed in offer mixed rooms. but he keed saying no, I almost begged him to call his boss to see if he will offer me a better solution considering that they also committed a mistake when they didn't notice as well once they sent me the confirmation of the booking and his answer was that my name was weird and hard to tell if it was a female or a male name (My name is Luz) I haven't met a guy with my name in my entire life and anyways I found his comment a little stupid.  After a few minutes of asking and begging for help I just gave up, I felt so lost and disappointed, they did not offer me any aside solution, no help, ANYTHING AT ALL!, not even a map or a recommendation of a different place to stay. I looked for a place for that night and then I ASKED THEM if there was room for me for the next two days because it was a 3-day reservation and they were full just for that night, just then he says yes but my question was... why he did not offer me that solution before?.","The Hostel, in general, is really good but they should pay attention to their staff and the kind of customer service and customer care that they provide.",1.0,May 2022,"July 13, 2022",Bed in Men's 8-Bed Dorm Ensuite,2,Solo traveler,8.3,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0

"It is a convenient space, but its service needs substantial improvement.","The beds are not set properly after checking out. When I checked in, I could not find blanket on my bed, so I had to go downstairs to the front desk to ask one. What's more, when my roommate checked in on 16th, he found his bed messy, on which the blanket was not folded up, and a cigarette end under his bed. After telling this to the receptionist, I received perfunctory answer; the receptionist told me that no one checked out from my room, while my previous roommate took away all of his belongings and my new roommate entered his bedroom with room card sent from reception desk; also, the receptionist answered my questions above by asking me to ask my new roommate to talk to them in person. Not surprisingly, I saw no change to that bed - the bed was still messy, and the cigarette kept staying there. The access control on bedroom door was troublesome; there has already been an access control on the entrance to our living room, so another access control is necessary. Once I forgot my card after taking shower, and I had to run downstairs with no clothes on me; I was looking for a telephone or communicator, but there was not. There was no free breakfast provided in this hostel, while the cafe on the first floor, owned by this hostel, was still open and crowded with guests in this hostel. The WiFi is poor in my room; it sometimes stopped working without reason, so I had to switch to my mobile data.","It is located in the Loop, with subway stations in minutes walk, and Millennium Park in 10 minutes walk,so it is pretty convenient. The doors, from front gate, gate to elevator lobby, to bedroom doors all require card to enter.

Exceptional,"Due to the location being in downtown there are a lot of sirens at random hours of the night and the building is right next to the raised L-train tracks so if you're a light sleeper then maybe bring some earplugs or headphones, it didn't personally bother me but I know it might bother some people. Also due to it being downtown there are a few homeless people who roam around along that street, the hostel does a very good job of keeping them away from and outside of the hostel but if you aren't prepared the homeless people in Chicago are some of the most aggressive panhandlers I've ever encountered in my trips across the US(this isn't really the hostels problem more of a warning to people staying there, the area is extremely safe but just stay aware). Also a small warning since I recommend public transit due to it being so developed and close to the hostel, be mindful that due to COVID-19 there are driver shortages so the buses/trains might be delayed more specifically the buses are effected by this so be mindful.","It was a nice place to stay there were pretty extensive safety measures. Such as, you had to keycard swipe to even get to the elevator hallway then once in the elevators you have to swipe your card again to select your floor and once you get to your room you have to swipe to enter the room. Also after hours they lock the side doors and you have to enter in through the main door which also is keycard protected and if you don't have a keycard you have to be buzzed in through the speaker. It made me feel very safe considering I was traveling alone, I visited a friends hotel in Chicago and walked straight up to her room and no one stopped or questioned me. The full service kitchen is pretty nice but due to COVID-19 the utensils/plates are disposable and you have to bring your own pots/pans/cooking utensils so keep that in mind. You do have to request a blanket at the front desk but you can do so at any point in your trip. The lockers are also larger than I expected I was able to fit a medium sized suitcase and my backpack in it and I still had some wiggle room. Don't forget to bring your own lock for the lockers.

Also due to it's location downtown right next to the raised L-train tracks, it is within walking distance to a lot of cool stores, tourist places, restaurants, and if you don't feel like walking far the bus stops and boarding stations for the L train are all within a 3-4 minute walk of the front door. I recommend downloading the transit apps(I think one is just called transit and the other in ventra)/using google maps and then buying day passes for the public transit because it'll give you unlimited rides on buses/trains for however many days you choose.",10.0,January 2022,"February 3, 2022",Bed in Women's 8-Bed Dorm Ensuite,9,Solo traveler,8.3,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1

okay,"the property and the whole area have gone hill. the towels and bed linen were damp. there was no blanket and I froze under the air conditioner.

"Many pros, but the beds make the place not worth it","THE BEDS. I have never been to jail, but I would imagine a jail bed feels like this. The first night I barely slept and debated just finding another hotel. To be fair, I’ve never stayed at a hostel before, so I do not know if this is typical, but I’m moving to Chicago and doing a lot of back and forth traveling, so I needed a good price.  My back was sore and my whole body ached every morning (I am 35) as did my 14 year old daughter, who also barely slept. To me, the bed is a deal breaker, and I need a comfortable and good night’s rest. For this reason alone, I wouldn’t return.
