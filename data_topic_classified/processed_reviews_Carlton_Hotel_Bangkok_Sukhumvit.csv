It being on a central street makes other areas easily accessible. However due to the traffic during peak times, it sometimes took longer than expected to get a Grab taxi. 

Rooms: very modern, sleek, minimalist. They had ample of space and the placement and allocation of space and furniture worked very well for us.

Tuxedo coffee bar: Great service and even better coffee. I got an Americano made with high quality beans. Ample of seating.

This is not single case, because we book today again and same story. This is not profesional for 5 star hotel in this price range, people must know what they pay and what they get. Now we are waiting  again for response which type of room they will give us, also after we choose one big bed... Not good, not to recommend for couples , and people who like to stay together.",Very nice location and very nice hotel. Good staff. Very pleasant stay.

I miss it already!,"During check-in I was told that breakfast wasn't included and I had to pay extra for it. Secondly, I was asked to leave a deposit of 2K baht per night(which added up to 12K baht for my entire stay) as security deposit and I was taken aback. A small argument ensued with the staff about it as I told them I wasn't informed and that I didn't prepare enough cash and I didn't have a credit card. It was quickly resolved as they graciously allowed for me to just put down 3K baht for the entire stay! Thankful for the top notch service from team Carlton! üôèüèª 
I will like to suggest to Booking.com to maybe be very intentionally clear about certain fees and charges and what's included and not included as part of the booking.

"Excellent hotel, highly recommend","Nothing to dislike. A point to note‚Ä¶

You will need to leave a deposit, about 2000 thb per night. This is common in larger hotels, the easiest way to pay is by credit card as they don‚Äôt accept debit card for the deposit. We didn‚Äôt have a credit card so we paid cash. As this was our last stop in Thailand it meant we took home 8000 thb so I‚Äôd recommend ensuring you have a credit card to cover this if you‚Äôre traveling Thailand.","Excellent experience for 4 nights in Bangkok. Excellent service, great room and good breakfast. 

We booked a club room which I highly recommend for access to the club lounge for free evening cocktails and canapes. The free laundry service was really helpful too after 2 weeks in Thailand.

The pool was welcome to cool down after a hot day exploring the city or an afternoon of relaxing.

The location is great, a short walk from the metro and BTS lines which can be used to navigate to most places in the city. Public transport is the best option in Bangkok as the traffic is very busy and can add upto an hour to your activity each way so use the BTS line or metro to riverboat.",10.0,April 2024,"April 13, 2024",Carlton Club Room,4,Couple,9.2,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Great panoramic views!,"While my stay at this hotel had some positive aspects, there were also some notable areas for improvement. One issue I encountered was the English proficiency of the staff. I had difficulty communicating with them and found that they struggled to understand me as well. This made it challenging to have conversations or to ask for assistance.

Another downside was the limited number of sunbeds at the swimming pool. During busy hours, it was difficult to find a spot to lay down and relax. Additionally, I found the quality of the food at the skybar to be subpar. Specifically, the calamari I ordered was chewy, and the ""cacio e pepe"" on the menu included chicken, which is not a traditional ingredient in this dish. Why do you have to put chicken everywhere? Please that's not italian food! We do not put rag√π alla bolognese in Pad Thai!!

Furthermore, I would not recommend the external massage service offered by the hotel. The hotel provided me with outdated pricing information, and the massage itself was quite painful, especially on the back and shoulders. I would suggest saving your money and exploring other options for a relaxing experience.","I recently stayed in a room with a breathtaking view of the city skyline. The room was spacious, and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The modern furniture added a stylish touch to the overall ambiance. The bathroom was equally impressive, featuring a large shower and a luxurious bathtub.

One of the highlights of my stay was the 10th-floor swimming pool, which was simply amazing. It offered a stunning panoramic view of the city and was the perfect spot for a refreshing swim or to relax under the sun.

Overall, I had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a luxurious and comfortable stay with stunning views.",9.0,March 2023,"March 28, 2023",Carlton Club Room,1,Couple,9.2,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

Good!,"1. The reception staff were a little unwelcoming. We arrived late in the evening following a 6.5 hour flight and the receptionist told us that although we had requested a king bed there was not any so we have twin beds. There was no apology or compensation for this. We booked our stay back in January so it was disappointing that we were not informed that this could not be addressed earlier, nor a chance to cancel before hand and rebook elsewhere. In addition, we were not told where we could access any information on the city, how to book taxis or the facilities the hotel had.

2. The hotel is on one of the busiest roads in Bangkok and it will often take 20minutes to wait for a taxi and then to get to a restaurant that was 4km away it took 1 hour.

Excellent Hotel in Sukhumvi area of Bangkok with very good rooms,"Everything was great, except on the last day of our stay, we had been given an extended check out time of 15:00 upon request but when we tried to get into our rooms at 14:45 to take our bags and checkout, we were locked out as they had locked the rooms. So we had to go down 30 floors again to speak to them to get the room unlocked. 
The person was a bit rude and and we explained that we had the room till 15:00. 
Anyways it would have been good to have a Telephone on each floor in case someone wanted to contact the reception for reasons like these.

An excellent new 5 star hotel in a good location,"As mentioned, the hotel is located near a somewhat dodgy but still safe part of town. The pool was a bit murky, even during early morning swimming. The breakfast was also a bit of a disappointment. While the choice offered was adequate, it was not comparable to that in other five star hotels in Bangkok. The restaurant staff could have been more attentive and when they did come by it was to (in an unusually direct way) remind us it was time to go even though it was still not yet 10.30. If you have the option, I'd suggest skipping the breakfast - which is also a bit overpriced for what it is. In fact, the room service breakfast is very nice and cheaper if you are paying extra for the hotel restaurant breakfast.","A lovely new hotel that is quite well located (though in a very touristy, somewhat downscale neighborhood it is a 10 minute walk to the Asoke BTS/Sukhumwit MRT lines). The rooms are large and service is excellent - room service is to be recommended - relatively quick with good, fairly priced food. The gym and pool (though a bit murky) are both nice.

I rate The Carlton as a highly professionally managed hotel which treats guests like royalty.,"I would have to be very picky to say I did not like anything but one thing stands out. The Carlton Club room has a balcony for smokers. When the door is opened to this area people in the main area get a huge waft of stinky smoke which lingers as the doors close slowly. I think the balcony for smoking is not necessary, especially as the hotel is meant to be non smoking.","Gym is great with excellent treadmills, pool is good too. Staff are very attentive and professional plus there is a lot of staff so you never wait long to be taken care of. Carlton Club is great for evening drinks and non alcoholic refreshments during the day for Carlton Club room holders. It is worth the extra money to take a Club room. Breakfast is a broad range of foods and eggs cooked to your liking. The location is great for entertainment, food and shopping. Anyone staying here will likely be very satisfied with their choice.",9.0,March 2023,"March 9, 2023",Carlton Club Room,4,Solo traveler,9.2,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0

Very Good,"Staff at the reception were not particularly welcoming . 
Also beware of the meter taxis  waiting in front of the Carlton enclosure   . We nearly got scammed . We trusted the Carlton  concierge who advised us to use one instead of a Grab to go to the Royal Palace . After 5 minutes in the meter taxi , the driver told us ,  the roads leading to the Palace were  closed and  instead  we would need to take a boat . He would get us to the pier  . He drove us to some pier where  an  old   rickety boat was waiting , with what we assumed were the patrons  asking  us eagerly 1500 baths each . We decided we were not getting on these unsafe looking vessels . 
Now in the middle of nowhere , we called the Carlton enquiring about the taxi driver they got us and the roads ‚Äú closure ‚Äú to the Royal Palace . Surprise surprise ‚Ä¶. The road to the Palace was fine ! 
By chance we managed to flash another taxi who stopped us after 10 minutes right in front of the Royal Palace  for a 100 baths .
Finally rest of the day went well but it could easily have turned into a nightmare .
I did tell the reception about this but they didn‚Äôt seem very concerned and I do not know if anything was done to protect the other hotel guests . 
What was  most  shocking is after looking online , this  Royal Palace scam is well known and tourists are warned about  waiting taxis in front of luxury hotels . 
Why  was that particular taxi allowed to wait right  inside the Carlton entrance ? 
As a result we took Grabs for the rest of our stay which was hassle free and seemed safer .",The  hotel was new and the bed was comfortable .

Disappointed,"Not professional at the reception. There is one of the receptionist when we arrived and the same one has done our check out. I waited 10 min in front of the desk before the receptionist cared to look up  at me and welcome us. That was only done when my husband who was outside came in and stood by me. The other factor that really made me feel unhappy about this hotel was, the same receptionist was more interested in informing as bout the high deposit they would block on my credit card. After this the receptionist asked what time was our flight in the next day. After informatiing , the receptionist was very fast to inform us had to leave the hotel at 12 ( normal check out time) But the issue was, when we read the paperwork the receptionist provided, that we actually had an executive room which could grant us, depending on the hotel occupancy, a late check out. 
Why didn‚Äôt the receptionist inform us this in the first place? Why be so unpleasant to tourists that actually contribute for the growth of the country?","Breakfast is really good with a good variety, and the staff at the restaurant are really nice

"Bad check-in, doesn't reflect a 5* hotel service - the stay finished better than it started","Check in was a rough and bad experience - we were told that there was no longer king bed size room, only double beds room. This was due to a request from one of our family to get all the rooms on the same floor. However when the staff changed our room, they didn't pay attention. We have already made the request for a king size bed during booking process, they know that we have an infant with us, we are a couple, yet, they assign a double bed room. For a 5* hotel, this is careless. The lady as the desk just told us no more king size bed room, no matter which floor, which was definitely not true. We called many times, insisting we want a king size, eventually, they gave us another room the day after one of our room checked out. Besides, they ask for a deposit on 6000 baths in cash, they don't accept debit card, meaning you have to block 6000 baths for the deposit that you can't use during your stay !

Terrible management and not 5 star service!,This was my first and last time staying at the Carlton Hotels. This is a ‚Äúwanna be‚Äù 5 star hotel but the service is not indicative of a 5 star! I‚Äôve traveled all over the world and this is perhaps the worst‚Äù 5 star ‚Äúexperience. First let me say that the concierge was AMAZING as well as the doorman Kook but that‚Äôs where the service stopped! The ladies at the front desk were cold and unhelpful. We asked if there was somewhere to warm our food that we had delivered. We were told no since we didn‚Äôt buy the food from the hotel! How awful! We even had a club room and you would think we could warm it in the club lounge at least(which has been my experience at other hotels) but no! Also the club room included laundry service (only 4 pieces per day per room) which is nothing for a family. I asked if they could wash some lightweight women‚Äôs cloth sneakers that had gotten very dirty in Chinatown and they said it wouldn‚Äôt fit in the washer? Like what! What kind of washer do you have where it won‚Äôt fit? It fits in my small washer at home just fine. Also my husband asked for masks at the front desk. The first day he got them and the next day the lady tried to say they didn‚Äôt have any. He told her he had just gotten them the day before and there was a whole box behind their counter. She finally gave him a mask and said they are normally for their personal use! Again what! Finally they charged me 1000 Baht because some of my temporary hair color got on the pillow after my hair was still a little wet from the pool earlier. They claimed that laundry couldn‚Äôt get it out which was a lie! It‚Äôs temporary hair color and it rinses right out of anything that I‚Äôve ever gotten it on. If they are using commercial grade cleaning products it should have come off easily. I asked twice to see the pillow after they allegedly tried to clean it and it was never produced.
