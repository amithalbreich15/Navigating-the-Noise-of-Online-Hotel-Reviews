Hotel is good but we hope to have more support from hotel.,"We had booked airport pick and we got the conformation from hotel’s message that driver will pick up at No. 8 pillar with board and logo showed Ibis. However, after we took car then arrived hotel, reception said the this wasn’t their shuttle car and driver was a liar. We needed to pay the traffic fee. And when we told any support from reception, they just said this was the problem from us and lair driver, they would not handle it. We can’t speak Vietnamese so we felt so helpless and headache. 
If you would like to get pick up service, it’s better to call hotel and ask them to make confirmation before taking car even it showed LOGO with Ibis. Because it maybe the fake LOGO and car.

Great choice hotel for stays near the Airport!,"Limited beers available at the roof top bar, the ones we ordered from the menu were out of stock so we had to pay for more expensive ones.  You can get Pho on the room service menu but not on the roof bar menu.  We had just arrived from the UK and were after Pho, so opted to hit the street sellers instead of having room service.","Flying in (late) and then out (early) of HCMC, we decided to book a hotel close to the airport to save time and hassle.  The Ibis is right next to the airport (you cam see it from the international airport exit) so we decided to book it and also take advantage of the complimentary pick up / drop off (organised simply via email in booking.com).  We arrived in HCMC and were picked up straight away and taken to the hotel where we had a spacious room with separate living area.  Check in was quick and the room was very clean.  Nice shower, comfy bed.  There is a nice roof top bar with a chilled vibe (beers are a little pricey but that’s to be expected from a roof top bar).  The pool is up on the roof too and actually is a good size if you wanted to swim a few lengths.  Great English spoken, no issues whatsoever and we would return!

The roof top bar was a great place to relax in the evening with a range of bar food. We didn't get to use the roof top pool next to the bar.  Free shuttle service to and from the airport, but make sure you can phone the hotel as our promised pick up was nowhere to be found.  Once we called a luxurious van arrived within 10 minutes, so no complaints on that score.  Allow plenty of time to get through Vietnamese customs and security.  Two hours for check in and getting through to the gate was just enough. An extra half hour would have been better.

There was a mix up with the meeting/ pickup which created an issue for me but it was resolved by flagging down the passing shuttle and jumping on. The hotel staff are seriously great. They didn’t try to justify their error and ‘Minh’ made it up to me by give me free long checkout (saving of $60AUD) which I greatly appreciated. The breakfast buffet was great with lots of variety, both western and Asian with some plant based options. The chef even made me a packed tofu banh Mi to take on the plane which I appreciated. The pool is great for early morning laps - it’s long enough and there’s a great view to watch the planes take off and land. There’s some great laneways and cafes in the streets around the hotel and then there’s a food hall directly on the right of the hotel in the shopping mall.

"Super comfortable, nice staff, close to the airport, good for airport transfer","Small detail but worth mentioning: The hotel does offer free transfer to the airport. However, it's a bus that takes about 15 minutes (not sure why it's taking longer, maybe they pick up other guests along the way). Add to that that you're expected to be at the bus 10 mins prior to departure and you got yourself a 30 minute journey, which defeats the purpose of being close to the airport by a little bit (not much but still). Alternatively, you can take a taxi for 100k which is what we did to be more flexible and save time.

Nice hotel close to the airport.,"Though I got the confirmation through Booking.com that we would have an extra bed in the room, when we arrived the extra bed had not been put down. After the hotel agreed to add said extra bed, we were told we had to pay extra for the breakfast, as it wasn't included in the price, despite us not wanting the breakfast. Again, we had to show our booking confirmation where IBIS clearly indicated that the extra bed was booked without the breakfast and that we agreed on it. 

When we checked out, the 2 counters which were operating were receiving both check ins and check outs at the same time. As new guests had just arrived, this meant that people who were checking out had to wait despite being on a tight timeline to catch the shuttle to the airport. Some people were quite angry at the situation and voiced it out.
Having one counter dedicated to check-in and one counter dedicated to check-out would make things much easier. 

After we arrived, we decided to order some food by the pool As the restaurant menu is not available between 3.00pm and 4.00pm we were asked to order from the room service menu, which we did. We ordered around 3.15pm, one hour later the food was still not ready.  Our food and drinks arrived long after the restaurant kitchen was actually opened.","Traveling as a family, it is always hard to find a place which can accommodate the 5 of us. The IBIS family room was perfect for our family. Even with an extra bed, we still had a lot of room to walk around the room, which we didn't expect.

The swimming pool side is nice and helps to relax after a flight.

Pleasant,"Transfer from the airport to the hotel took a very long time. A person who was supposed to meet us upon our arrival wasn't there, didn't pick up the phone, and ignored  WhatsApp messages for 15 minutes. Then we had to wait for another passenger, and then for a driver to arrive. 
 We had an overnight stay in between flights, and time was really crucial for us, as we needed to sleep. So it would be faster to get a taxi from the airport, as the hotel was only 4 minutes away.
At the reception we found only 1 person working, which is strange, as this is an airport hotel and they were expecting guests from the transfer. So we had to wait some more.

And the last unpleasant surprise was a limited room service menu. All items are available until 10-30 pm. We'd arrived around midnight, so we had only 4 options available on the menu. That's a very limited choice, considering that it's an airport hotel and people obviously use it in between flights quite often.","Room was clean. Hotel is very close to the airport, only 4 minutes.

A pity that the last night in Vietnam was in this disappointing hotel,"Our room was the smallest and the most expensive we had had in 20 nights in Vietnam, With 2 single beds - the narrowest they could be and still little room to move. I caught my shin twice on the wooden corner of the bed .
The lifts were difficult to make work -to get from our room on the 8th floor to the terrace on Top floor we often had to go down to ground level to then go up to the top floor 
We paid the extra money to keep the room until we were to go on their shuttle bus at 5pm but reception forgot to update the system so we were locked out of the room and not able to use the lift. To sort out this oversight my wife had to go to reception in  her swimwear. No apology was given for the problem the staff had caused us
Our plan was to eat before we went to the airport but BOTH restaurants were closed-no food available. We were told one was to open at 4pm but that did not help us.",the roof top swimming pool and sun terrace were beautiful (pool towels provided).Evening meal in the roof top restaurant was very good with excellent service. All this made better by the specular view over Saigon and its airport at night. The shuttle transfer was in a really luxurious vehicle-a stylish end to our tour.,3.0,November 2022,"November 28, 2022",Standard Twin Room -Complimentary Round-trip Airport Transfer upon request,1,Couple,8.3,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0

Worst service in Saigon,"My wife opinion:
1. Service. I was walking to the hotel from the airport with a huge suitcase half my weight. The suitcase had a broken wheel and it was a real challenge. Finally got to the hotel. The three front desk employees didn't lift a finger as I crawled towards them, even when I stopped in the middle of the lobby to catch my breath. I never received any help.
2. The flush in the sink in the room did not work: it was plugged with a stopper that could not be pulled out.
3. The fridge is empty, no minibar, nothing. In the far corner, a hanged mouse is swinging slowly and sadly. Quite strange, considering that the room was not cheap, to put it mildly.

My opinion:
My wife came to you from the airport with a broken suitcase - and no one helped her. There were three of you standing there at the reception - you are the worst representatives of the vietnamese people and you disgrace them with your behavior. We have never encountered such vile and disregardful attitude as in this hotel, not worth its money and its stars. 

I curse you.","1. Close to the airport.

Personnel used the situation,"I booked this hotel for its location and as I had stayed in other Ibis hotels, I believed that the experience would be good and safe for my mother.  As my mother's flight was changed I urgently booked this hotel for her to stay overnight. I was in contact with a person who arranged an airport shuttle and informed them that she doesn't speak English. We agreed on the time she would take the shuttle bus back to the airoport the next day and they reassured me that it was arranged for her. In the end, the hotel personnel used the situation to their advantage: my mother was overcharged for the room, denied access to the swimming pool area of the hotel and instead of the shuttle bus back to the airoport she was offered to use a taxi. She used an online translator to try to fix all of that, but it helped only with a shuttle bus after she had to insist.",The hotel is close to the airoport and has cafes and restaurants around.

Disappointed,"We paid more than any other hotel in our 4 week stay in Vietnam and this was a disappointment. We received a free room upgrade, and the room was more like a mini apartment. There was a kitchen area, but no crockery or cutlery so was pretty useless. No coffee either. Worse of all we were woken at 6.00am by a loud banging that reverberated around the whole room. We were on floor 15  directly below the gym and the noise was probably someone dropping weights on to the floor. This wasn't just a bang or thud, it really jangled the nerves as it sounded like someone was going to come through the ceiling. It carried on for the next two hours, so we gave up on trying to get any sleep. The main reason for choosing this hotel was to be well rested for the long flight home. We complained and the staff were on the face of it understanding, and offered us free late check out. This was appreciated, but  that said the hotel must know that this is an issue and by this time the damage was done as we had our sleep disturbed.  The gym needs to be in the basement not on the roof.
Apart from that there were no major issues, but the most important thing is a good nights sleep. The rooftop pool was nice, although sunbeds were limited. The location was ok only in terms of airport access, however that was the reason we chose it. The staff were all lovely.","Friendly staff. Efficient, free airport transfer.

They told the staff and the staff kept saying:”follow instructions” even though my dad is 75 years old and told them that the aircon is so hot. Until 2am in the morning, the room was 28 or 29C degree and the window can not open, my mum kept calling the reception and noone picked up the phone. She went to the ground floor and 3 staff were sitting there and talk to each other and ignored the phone. My mum is sick until now. I think I should not pay for the price $153 including breakfast and received a bad service like that.
