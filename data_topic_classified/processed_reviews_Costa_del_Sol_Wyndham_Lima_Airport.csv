After 13 hours of transit, clearing customs twice in MEX and LIM, and arriving near midnight, the ability to get to our room and shower and rest by only taking a few steps was heavenly. I was near delirious at that point, and the woman at the front desk was SO patient and kind as I struggled to put words together in Spanish or English (my husband later told me that she said ""you did good!"" when she handed back our documents and room key, but I missed this!). The rooms were comfortable and clean, bottles of water were free and very appreciated - also welcome drinks at the bar, which we didn't end up taking advantage of. I noticed that their spa is open 24/7 so that whenever your flight arrives or departs, you can get some relief.

Positive and negative,"The rudeness of the staff at check-in. I have never been attended by someone as rude as the guy who did the check-in. After asking for my passport without even greeting me, he asked for a credit card for the payment. It was declined, which was strange, and he asked me for another card. The second payment was declined too, so I asked him to use another reader, but he refused to do so. He then had the audacity to ask me if I had enough credit left on the cards, treating me as if I was a thief with fake or stolen credit cards. The third card was also declined and only then he accepted to use another card reader. The payment was of course immediately approved. No apologies, nothing. This guy is a total disgrace. Besides, one of the supposedly declined payment had actually been approved, and I have now been charged twice for the  same reservation. And of course, I will have to sort this out with the credit card company myself because there is no way I am going to call Peru from Europe at my own expenses.
The following day, I went to reception and paid for a drink in cash. The bank note was of course accepted straight away, but I had to insist for a receipt because I was reassured that the cash payment was OK. Of course because it would be easier to successfully charge my card afterwards on the grounds that cash payment can never be traced.
It's a very beautiful hotel and the rooms are big, bright and comfortable. But when you are left with all the unnecessary hassle of having to dispute a double charge and a slight doubt about the processing of a cash payment, it leaves a bitter taste. It's a shame.","Fantastic location, the hotel is linked to the airport by a bridge, so it is extremely convenient. You don't need a shuttle or have to walk long after or before a flight.

Stay alert when crossing to the hotel or use the overhead connecting walkway from the airport,"I knew to expect scammers outside such as taxi drivers etc but we didn’t expect the extent they’d go or that they would be impersonating Wyndham staff. I was walking in front of my partner when he was pushed hard from behind so he knocked our trolley into me (enough that my heel was bleeding under my sandal). I have a balance problem and use a walking stick. Then we were told by men, in what looked hotel staff uniforms including identity badges around their necks, that they were Wyndham staff and to please follow them for our safety. They led us around the building, not to the entrance across from the airport. I could see the guest guest/car drop off entrance further on but by this time a number of men were harassing me to show our documentation/reservation and I clued on, realised they are not employees and we pushed passed them as quickly as we could. I fully understand that this isn’t the hotel’s fault but the staff all knew about it so I'm sure the Managers and owners do too. I believe the hotel has a duty of care to their customers and at minimum could inform guests that they can use the overhead walkway to directly enter and leave the hotel to/from the airport. We were only told about this by the porter (William or Willie I think) who was by far the friendliest of the staff that we encountered. Having security or a doorman outside the airport side hotel entrance could be helpful too.",The Wyndham itself was fine. The staff were mostly okay. We stayed there twice for one night before and after visiting Machu Picchu and the Amazon. Both times they looked after our larger suitcases while we spent a night or two away. The first booking went smoothly but the night check in staff seemed very much there to do their job and that was it. We were  a little stressed as we had been accosted on the way in but they didn’t care or want to know if we are okay. They knew about the scammers masquerading as hotel staff outside (see below for further details) but shrugged their shoulders when we asked why isn’t anything done about it or at minimum why aren’t guests warned.  The room was fine. Expensive for even an airport hotel given the room (it was large but basic) and minimum amenities.

Huge disappointment,"As I say, location is wonderful and very close to the airport, but this should not be the reason to behave towards the guests with so little respect and trust. The first I would comment on is check in. One needs to pay even before one sees the room. This is unacceptable, I have never experienced this. I understand that they may be worried that people will not have time to pay during check out, but this can be better communicated, for instance, receptionist should say: 'what time is your flight? It may be easier for you to pay now so that you do not worry about this in the morning'. or something like that, but No, one is simply told 'This is the decision of the management of the hotel'. This spoils all the good facilities they have, and really, next time in Peru, I would stay in another hotel at the airport.

Second, there is a coffee machine in the room, but it did not work. We tried to make a coffee, we did everything what seemed logically correct, but we  could not get a coffee. Also there were only two coffee capsules, one decaf and one decaffeinated, so only one person actually could have a coffee. I suggest you provide instructions how to use this machine, or change the machine in a case it is not working. Also, there was no kettle in the room, but there were tea sachets??? I do not understand the logic. Bathroom shower could also be modernised.

Check out was terrible. We were worried to have a breakfast because the queue for our flight was a bit longer then expected. As I was checking us out, I asked first can we come back after we check out, we were told that we can, then, I asked, could we have a boxed breakfast just in case, and then the receptionist started to attend another guest. I was left alone, and I was told to join the queue again. I did not want to do so.

Last, we paid much higher rate than it was published on booking.com. I assume this was added tax, and if it was, I would suggest that full rate is actually displayed if possible.","The concierge team was lovely, especially Miguel, I want to really thank him for all the help we received.

This hotel is perfect. Incredible customer service, help with bags into the airport, into your rooms, there's not tons 0f cheap chemical air fresheners (except for in the spa there's a super gross one in the bathroom) NOT RELAXING to breathe in toxins. 

The breakfast is great... when you go later, if you have to get up at 4 for your flight they have fruit and cereal but no real food unfortunately untill later. 

They can call you a great taxi. 

They have wonderful customer service and are EXTREMELY accomidating. 

Unfortunately I got put up for a second night in Lima across the street at the holiday inn and it truly sucks in comparison.

Very, very unprofessional. A word of advice, many people NOT from Peru speak Spanish. 
   I am a single woman traveling alone, my room was placed in 603, I was absolutely shocked to find that extensive building and remodeling was happening in the 600 hallway. I had to step over construction materials and the noise was crazy. My room was the last one and all the rooms before mine were construction rooms. I immediately went back downstairs and the manager was at the desk at this time. The check in reception people were finally doing their job with “the boss” standing right behind them. I went straight to the manager instead of talking to the unprofessional clowns. The manager made sure that I was put into a proper room right away. The thing is though with the price of the hotel, I should have been put into a proper room in the first place. Not in a construction zone like it was the butt of a joke.

The concierge tried to retrieve my bag at that time and asked me to tip the other man $1 or $2 before he left. I was very shocked that the man from the hotel was trying to get me to tip $2 to someone who only helped me for 100 yards, and even then it wasn’t necessary - I just thought he was being kind. Anyway, I told them I was not going to tip $2 for such a short distance (and I didn’t have cash on me anyway) then I told the concierge that I would handle my bag the last 50 yards to the hotel. It seems like they have a deal and do this often. Beware - and if you can manage your own bags, do so unless you want to be scammed.

Poor service and outdated facilities; would not stay again.,"As soon as I walked in the door, sweaty with tons of bags on my arms, I was told when I was already far into the lobby that I had to go back outside of the hotel to cleanse my hands. No one offered to grab my bags for me as I did so. I understand there’s a pandemic, but a guest should never be made to carry 100+ pounds of their belongings back outside to access a single hand cleansing station - there could be multiple such stations in the lobby, or the attendants could themselves be armed with some Purell, or at the very least someone could offer to help their guests with their bags.

We were offered “free drink” tickets we were told we could exchange at the bar, but which actually corresponded to two free bottles of water that we had to collect from the restaurant. Typically, a hotel room already has two free bottles of water inside the hotel room itself. This hotel room did not have water. Essentially we were given tickets and made to go to the restaurant to get the two bottles of water that should have already been in our room.

The room is ugly and bland, decorated in dingy shades of brown. It looks as though it hasn’t been re-decorated since the 1960s. The halls are similarly dark and dingy looking.

We were told we could have breakfast at 4am, which was important as we had a 6am flight. We waited until nearly 4:30am and still, half of the food had not yet been put out; there were several empty food containers that hadn’t been filled, so I knew more was meant to come. The only food available was a container of extremely watery scrambled eggs, some bread, and a tray of sliced cheese and ham. Unlike at other hotels where they take your coffee order and offer to make eggs to order, no one addressed us or offered to attend to us as we sat there. Really bad breakfast.

We arrived 40 minutes before the 2 pm check in time and were waiting in the lobby for the entire 40 minutes (and, for the record, weren't offered the drink tickets for water from the bar or the wifi password while we waited), so there was ample time to inform us of the problem. No, they waited until after we had checked in and paid for the room and gone upstairs (no one helping us with our bags) to call us on the phone to tell us that the hot water wasn't working but they were working on it. 5 hours later, the claimed it would be fixed in an hour. 2 hours after that, we were told ""another few hours."" We'd just gotten back from the Amazon, covered in sweat and sunscreen and insect repellant, but we had to go to bed without a hot shower. And the hot water still wasn't working the next morning, so we complained at checkout only to be told, ""Oh, but we told you before check in and we offered to cancel the reservation for you.""

After to explain her my problem, she passed my key in a machine. I told her please, check well the key because I did not want to retour to the counter. She told me, if you have the same problem you can find a telephone in the corridor and you can call me back!!!

Horrible experience,"The way the person at the front desk acted after checking in gave me the impression that I was in a police station not in a hotel.
On arrival I had two of my  sisters waiting for me at the hotel, and after checking in, I was not allowed to go up my room with them, the clerk at the reception stopped me when we were going toward the elevator. I was told that my sisters were required to identified with him and leave their ID while they were in the hotel, when I asked him to show me where I could see or find this regulation under the hotel rules, he reply in a nasty that he was not going to get into an argument with me.
At the hotel regulations I could not find anything requiring  that any hotel guest need it not only to be identify but also leave their identification DNI in this case  at the front desk. I have been in many hotels of the same chain in Peru and never before had this issue. Several timesI have been  contacting this hotel via emails and messages so they could tell me where I could find that regulation and so far I got no answer.
