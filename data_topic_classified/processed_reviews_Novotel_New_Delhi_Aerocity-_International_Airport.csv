The most impressive aspect was the excellent service the staff provided, who were attentive and efficient.

However, as a vegetarian, I found that the North Indian vegetarian options were limited compared to the numerous non-vegetarian choices, even in the buffet. Despite this, the service was excellent, and I preferred opting for the buffet rather than individual orders as it offered better value for the same price.

Value for money with smile 😊,"I have always experienced that if I book a taxi to airport from hotel it’s never there waiting even if called the reception night before,I suggest to go down to reception 15 mins before you asked for taxi ,especially if you have flight prior to 7 am to catch to avoid any haste getting to airport.","As mentioned in my previous review and the reasons I keep on returning to this property is best value for money compared to any other hotel in aero city,a cluster of hotels including international chain of hotels located 10-15 mins from New Delhi domestic and international terminal. Novotel in my opinion offers everything that other hotels do ,but at best best price as I have had stays in other hotels of aero city as well .
Also the staff is very polite,smiling and helpful.

Not pleasant,"At the breakfast the F&B service staff was not at all professional . I ordered Dosa and he simply said that the chef is not there once’s chef will come then only I will have.

In a same month this is my second visit but at the time of checkin the front office team was not having my details and he took 20 minutes for all scanning the documents very slow .

Need to improve the quality as we thought of 
going as it represents the big brand like Accor .

 People should be guest oriented  they are in there own world very bad experience.

A bitter sweet experience,"This I don't like: 
1- Upon my arrival my room smelled VERY bad. I'm not a complainer in general but it was so bad that for the first time in my life, I went down and asked them to change my room. The second room they gave me was much better but it still smelled bad (a lot less), but this time I just did not want to go and complain again... 
2- The floor was very dusty. Despite the room service, it seems that they don't vacuum everyday (?), The bathroom floor was not clean, the carpet was super dusty...
3- The prices for consumption at the hotel are abusive. For example I paid 680 Rp for a double espresso coffee (7.70 Eu), I paid nearly 20 euros for 2 local beers.","The rooms were great size and comfortable. The staff is very friendly. The distance to the airport is great and if you want to go downtown you are near the Metro/Subway/Tube (literally 10 minutes walk).

Novotel - we'll be back for more!,The bellhop and luggage counters are always busy and we had to wait on few occasions to get our needs sorted out. Also their taxi service was super expensive (expected!) - airport drop (only 5 Kms) was Rs. 1800 + taxes for Toyota Innova and it doesn't come with luggage carrier (some stupid rule in Delhi?) so if you have extra-bags that won't fit all in the back then you will have to get a second cab. We were 4 with 4 large suitcases and some smaller items so ended up negotiating with an outside vendor to make two trips (if needed) for Rs.1500 but the guys was able to fit us all without the need for luggage carrier in a single trip.,"Good location and good value - particularly if you are looking for 5 star properties near the Delhi airports (both International and Domestic). The main restaurant is buffet style and had sufficient variety to satisfy the adults and kids in the family. Some preparations were hit or miss at times but overall the quality and variety was better than that of the sister Pullman Hotel (more expensive) as we tried their buffet as well and were not impressed. The waiting staff is generally very courteous and helpful and they would listen to your feedback with care and urgency even if they are unable to fix anything. This was kind of a transit hotel for us and the good thing is that we were able to leave some of our heavy luggage with them in their cloak room as we traveled elsewhere on Domestic flights for few days. There was absolutely no extra charge for this facility and it worked out very well for our needs as we had to anyway come back to Delhi to catch the international flight and stayed again in this hotel for the night before the final journey back.

I had a decent enough massage which I prebooked and the lady was super polite. Hovewer it was extremely over priced, I live in London and this was above most London spa prices and didn't give you any more in terms of an experience than normal spas I've been to that were half the price. I wouldn't recommend going there for those prices to be honest. Hotel is nice enough, just use the sauna and pool to relax.
Oh and unlimited free water and tea in the room, was a lovely gesture.","Stayed for one night as had a flight the next day. I wanted a spa hotel to indulge myself and the stay was pleasant. The spa facilities were good overall. Had to cross over by the pool to use the sauna and steam room next door (had to ask someone as ones in our hotel were turned off). The sauna was nice, steam room was not working 100%.used the outdoor pool in the evening which was lovely and felt safe for a woman alone, as staff nearby. Also sauna and steam room were gender separated in the changing rooms.
The bed was super comfy and so was the rest of the room. Breakfast was nice but I got an upset stomach, may be down to me becoming relaxed with disinfectant as was the end of my trip.

As our incoming flight arrived at 8 am, we requested an early check in and were told the only option is to book an extra night, and so I did. On our return journey the flight was to leave at 8 am and so we couldn't have the breakfast next morning, we requested to change the inclusive breakfast to dinner instead for the previous night and were told NO! It is unfortunate they hide behind protocols and are inflexible for small costs.

Nice hotel but...,,"Negativ: ""Hospitality""...Dear Novotel, i booked breakfast but can't have it because leaving early. I asked for have dinner instead and of course paying the difference. Not possible. The booked ""package"" is what it is. Customers Problem. Really that unflexible?
The loud music in the ground floor don`t match and don't make me feel to be in a great hotel. More quiet, relaxed and smooth music would be good. Also there were some kind of evening party at the pool with really loud music and bass that let you don't sleep. Positiv: Because of that i asked for another room late that evening and they gave me one which was great!
positiv: The room is really great and quiet. A lot space, nice bathroom. Also a really great gym. Many options to spend time in that hotel. The cleaning staff and also the security staff is very kind (meanwhile otherwhere in that hotel staff feels a bit faceless and less welcoming to me).
Good connecting to the airport. Use ola (aprox 100 - 150 r) or Metro (20 r)

Good,"Well, this is the first hotel in my travel history which created so much issue for early check in, given the fact that the hotel is next to the airport where flexibility should be the prime concern. And I can confirm that this is not the norm because I have been routinely doing this during my travels since the airport hotels understand that we do not plan the flight timings. I can also confirm that during my return trip I stayed in Holiday Inn just next to this hotel where I checked in 3-4 hours early (no issues, no charges). Yesterday, I was in Helsinki and I checked out 4 hours later to match with my flight timings at no extra cost. Just to add, I also informed them that I would check out at 5 am the next day to take my flight and this was not an availability issue because they let me check in after I paid half of one night's price.

Not great this time. Was better last couple of times. Maybe hiring new ones have not been effective.,"Couple of actions by the staff (only this time) was uncouth and borderline racist. Conveyed my displeasure to Duty Manager, who I hope took action. Reiterating here those experiences, 1) when a security person near the lift asked the lady for ID who was with my friend. They were married and had checked into the hotel in the morning. Extremely demeaning, I don’t think they will ever check into this property. 2) The bartender (with specs) behind Novotel front desk is as good as a Gurgaon local bar bartender, just better groomed. Doesn’t have a welcoming attitude, more like a cashier and told us that he would not be able to serve our drinks in the smoking outdoor space, but did serve another guest after 5 minutes. This is just ugly. Just don’t feel like going back to the same place again. You are just encouraging ppl to be discourteous. I am sure if I had escalated this to your duty manager, he would have made that guy serve me outside, but why to reach that situation.","Stayed here quite a few times. Amazing hospitality, seamless check in and 15 minutes away from airport. Can’t ask for more. Excellent front desk team (Osama, Raas and the Concierge, forgetting his name who helped me get my phone).

However, the so-called five-star hotel receptionist RAJ destroyed our entire itinerary.The check-in personnel Raj was a liar and a highly unprofessional person. Because of this individual, we unnecessarily wasted one of our day and completely destroyed our plans. The awful check-in experience. I requested numerous times that I arrive at 10 a.m. on October 18 and check out at 5 a.m. on October 21, but I arrived at 12:30 p.m. When I asked for at least one room of two rooms, the check-in counter initially denied, saying that we would have to wait because we had arrived early. After three requests, he finally granted us a room after an hour of waiting. then, my next available room was ours, but he did not provide us of this until 4 PM. Because of this liar, our entire day was wasted. When I arrived at the accommodation, I discovered that both rooms had been vacant for two days, that no guests had been there, and that the check-in staff had been lying about the presence of guests. Is this treatment like a five-star hotel? I then vowed that I wouldn't spend any additional money at this hotel on food or entertainment, choosing instead to eat at a nearby five star properties. I believe the check-in counter employees' smiles were lost on another planet, or they were working longer hours under pressure, or there was a shortage of staff members and insufficient training. Even though one of our room ac units wasn't working, I chose not to report it and instead chose to turn the unit off entirely or request house keeping service for the three days. Rest everthing is okey.. Close to Airport and some staffs are very nice and polite.","The Swimming pool, the House keeping staff, the amenities in the room are good, but aircon was bad whatever it did not move more or less then 19.5 degree.

What a treat it was!! Must say we loved it. Even though we stayed for just few hours She made our stay memorable and sweet. Thank you Prerna 😊

Disappointed with the service - slow and non attentive staff,"This stay was my worse experience with Novotel in all these years. I'm not sure if they are short staffed or it's complacency due to good number of bookings but the service is very slow and it takes forever to get them to do anything. 

1. If you arrive by a morning flight and are waiting to check in (before 12noon) and want to get some food, firstly food in the bar or restaurant is not available before 12noon. On their bar menu they say pizza is available from 11am but when we ordered it at 11.30am we were told we can't order it before 12noon. Despite it clearly mentioned on their menu that it's available from 11am.

2. My colleague accidentally dropped a glass bottle of water near the lift and immediately rushed to inform the guest services to display a sign and have it cleaned up however her and I had to stand near the lift telling hotel guests to be careful for a good 10-12mins before someone from the Novotel team came. We kept going to the guest services desk and reminding the lady a couple of times and she would just say 'please wait we are sending someone' - as if we were employees of the hotel and it was our duty to stand there.

3. My colleague requested for a sanitary napkin at the guest services desk and it took them 20mins to bring her a sanitary. All the time we were told it's on the way. It would have been quicker to go to the 24/7 and buy a pack

4. The check out takes ages. There is no separate desk for check out. So you have to wait in line with guests checking in. And even when you do that and the queue grows, no one jumps to help. Infact while i was waiting, another gentleman walked ahead of me and the lady at the reception did not once tell him to wait his turn. Instead she started doing the formalities. I even requested someone to quicken the process as I had to rush to the airport but no one even looked up from their desk.",Clean comfortable room and great location,3.0,May 2023,"May 27, 2023",Standard King Room with Free WiFi,2,Solo traveler,7.7,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0

Good location but not recommended for hospitality and rooms.,"On checkin, the staff were not pleasant and were attending to other guests while checking me in, this did make me angry.

That is totally unacceptable and pathetic as this booking was made 3 months ago and there was communication between the hotel and myself in the days leading up to the day.
Lunchtime buffet selection was limited, you're better off and it's cheaper to go for their a la carte menu, which has a much more interesting offering.

Bad experience with a kid.,"Main reason for my low rating is that Novotel mailed me a confirmation for my request for an extra bed for my 6 year old kid 2 days before my travel. I reminded them when i checked in, got a confirmation, then I called and said that the extra bed could be put in the room even if we wouldnt be in the room, got a confirmation. Then we went out for dinner and got back after 3h and found that there was no bed. This followed a lot of calls with housekeeping and their answer was that they didnt have any extra beds. Until 11, the calls continued and every time, I had to explain the issue to a different person and nothing worked. Half the time, housekeeping did not lift the call. We had an early morning wakeup to catch a flight and couldnt go anywhere at 11.30 in the night with a kid. So, we ended up staying up half the night with this inconvenience.

Not a good experience at all.,"The poor rating I'm giving for mainly 2 reasons as mentioned below:
1. I called around 12:50 AM to the reception to collect my baggage as my flight was at 3:35 AM, I wanted to reach the airport by/ before 1:30. Reception told me he's sending someone in 10 mins, no one comes. after 15 mins I called again then they told me to send in another 10 mins. no one comes again. Then finally my wife went below to ask them personally and they were free and came just after that but by that time I already lost around 30 mins. What is the use to pay more than 10K/ night for 5 star hotel if the room service is not upto the mark and caused us to delay reaching the airport where we faced issue due to late arrival.
2. Finally when we went down with luggague after around 45 mins of delay we asked for the CAB which must be there already as I already requested at the time of booking and when I 1st called them but no sign of CAB. They asked me about the money for cab beforehand to submit and when I gave them 1500 rs Cash they were not having 150 rs change to give me back. 5 Star hotel doesnt have 150 rs change, can you believe it? Though then I paid by card but still when you're already rushing this small things can impact a lot. After it they called for CAB which came after 5 mins and we didnt get any response untill we asked about it.

It caused us a delay of overall 1 hour and caused trouble at the airport too with a huge line at immigration and difficulty to clear the queues.

So, overall not a good experience at all and never gonna go to this hotel again and will not recommend to any of my friends and family members. It was my 4th stay in Aerocity this year and other 3 hotels (IBIS, Holiday Inn, Plaza) were far better in hospitality. I usually dont provide the feedback but this time due to all trouble and delays I had to with the root cause.","Comfortable room, Dinner and location.",4.0,November 2021,"November 25, 2021",Standard King Room with Free WiFi,1,Couple,7.7,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0

M Vineet and  team need to pull up thier socks big time,"As Mr. Vineet Mishra see the below points 
1. During the check in Auth was taken but no slip was given to me which the staff at the time of checkout,  he was asking for . Guest might have forgotten but this should  be part of Guest SOP
2. The telephone standards are missing. I called.room.service as.well as reception , no one answered the call in first attempt either I had to wait for anyone yo pickup the phone or had to cancell and dial back again and then a person answered that too after 4-5 rings 
3. The cleanliness in my room 322 was the worst. I tried to make tea for my old aged mother and upon checking the cups , they had strand of dust at the bottom .first I thought to clean but then thought why should I as I paid for it and this should have been checked prior the checkin. The icing on the cake was when the staff came to replace the cups,  he was re-checking the cups making us feel that we might be just complaining for the same of it. This is made us feel as cheated. Even the bed sheet had a foreign object on it and made me feel unsafe in term of hygiene  .this is not acceptable from a  5 star hotel . 
4. The checkout process was a trauma.  There was just ONE staff the time of checkout and even dyring my checkout process , the staff was bothered by other  guests, some came for check-in and some in house , which resulted in a delay for my check in and those guest just barged into the staff breaking the que and not even caring another guest is being attended . NOT  A GREAT GUEST SERVICE BEING A 5 STAR. hotel should look into the guest experience BIG TIME .else do not call  your self 5 star . This kind of Service is no where near a 5 star.  Even 4 star propery Hyatt place dubai was more above your service .

"DO NOT STAY HERE, THE DUTY MANAGER NAVEEN LIES.","on arrival after having booked on booking.com I was told the price of the room was actually closer to £100 rather than the £78 on booking. I had chosen a cheaper hotel as was just staying from 6pm to 3am. I was also told the airport transport would be £20 (it is less than 5 mins from the airport, a ride which would have cost 200irs (£2) in a normal taxi. When I bought this up I was told by the guy at reception that I needed to take it up with booking.com and basically that it is what it is and I should just take a normal taxi then. when I advised him as a girl travelling alone in Delhi in a normal taxi wasn’t really sensible, he shrugged his shoulders and said no it’s not safe. I asked to speak to the manager and was told he was busy. I asked that he call my room. He did not. After calling down 3 times I eventually spoke with Naveen the duty manager and told him what had happened. He quite rudely said well what do you want from me then? I was taken aback and asked him what he meant, to which he replied well you want something, what is it? 
Eventually he advised that he had not taken payment for transport I required to the airport and therefore would make that complimentary. All then seemed well and resolved….
At 3am I went down to find no car, however the reception also disputed the fact it was complementary until they read the notes on the computer 🤦🏽‍♀️. 
I have now reached my destination and 2 days after leaving have noted the hotel has now requested payment from my bank for the so called complementary airport transport, which was documented as so by the duty manager Naveen. 
I am shocked at the way I was spoken to, about the misinformation on cost, and the fact that I was advise airport transport on my return would be given as complementary but was not and they have slyly requested payment 2 days after I have left. 
Unfortunately the staff here are liars and rude.

Leaves a lot to be desired from the stars it has on it's mast,Check in took 35 mins to be exact from the moment we walked through the doors with family. Lot of fumbling around for a simple straightforward booking.com checkin. Got an email and message twice that my card was invalid before I got there and each time I updated online only to find out they didn't even try charging the card. Fantastic. Had 2 rooms for us. Luggage and the process to take luggage upstairs to the room took another 30 mins while I was waiting in the lobby and staff were busy handling luggage for guests who rolled in after us. One of the room had a constant light blinking from the smoke alarms and had a lot of mosquitoes. So much so that we had to ask for a mosquito repellent because the kids started scratching from mozzie bites. Paid cash for the reservation and had some balance left that hotel had to pay me on checkout since they didn't had change. Guess what...next morning they told me they are less on change so will I accept a lower amount. What was I supposed to do..miss a $3k flight for a few bucks change? Seriously though will you guys accept if I come there next time and say I am a bit short on cash? I usually stay at Hyatt or Radisson but thought this time will give them a try. Never again if this is the experience that people get at Novotel.

The worst part was check out. I had called them in the morning for a cab to drop at airport at 12. At around  11.40, I called them to send trolley to our room. Then the wait begins. Someone came after 40 mins and we had followed up 4 times in between.  I got a call at 1210 when they asked my checked out time, I had to tell them I was waiting for the trolley for so long. We even decided to take our luggage down ourselves. We started doing it then someone showed up and moved our luggage. At the reception the wait game begins again.

pathetic. waste of money.,"I stayed at this property for 2 nights 3 days. I booked it via the booking.com and selected the “pay at property” option. When I was paying the amount, the front desk assistant asked me for extra money which was around 19000₹ something. However, as per my hotel vouchers it was 16632₹ (included taxes). Though, I was aware of my amount. so I asked him to explain and he tried to make me fool. Gladly, Which he couldn’t. After my checkout I noticed that he charged extra 500₹. So this is how this property is trying to looting their guest.

This is not a 5star property at all. They only have big spacious area. Rooms are not up to the mark. Novotel doesn’t have a good quality of table in their rooms.
