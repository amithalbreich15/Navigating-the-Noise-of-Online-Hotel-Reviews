"Good stay, but be careful from fake taxi services in the name of the hotel","When we arrived at the airport, we could not see the promised shuttle, thus inquired about the shuttle location. A taxi driver with a PAITED WOODEN BOARD with name of the hotel approached us pretending that he was the driver from the hotel. He told us that we will be transferred to hotel free of charge but need to pay $5 as airport entry fees by credit card. As he had the board of hotel name in his hand, we believed. When credit card was given to him near the hotel , the payment got denied by our credit card company as the amount asked was beyond the credit card limit. We tried another card, and same thing happed. When we saw the messages from card company afterwards, it was $3000. But, when we got a call from credit card bank, he hurriedly dropped us near the hotel and fled.   
This is certainly creating a bad reputation to hotel and hotel should investigate who are these people who are trying to cheat the passengers in their name and book them to police.

Excellent airport hotel but pay attention to the shuttle collection policy.,"The shuttle collection is a disaster, the worst I've experienced. It must be organised through WhatsApp and response times vary. Drop off on the other hand is seemless which begs the question why collecting guests is made so complicated.

I'm suggesting all staff are given simple basic words to learn. Especially if they are on the front desk and answering the phone.","Very nice spacious room.

Superb! --just tweak the airport shuttle pickup!,"Get clearer on that airport shuttle pickup, but otherwise, I have zero complaints! Also wifi was great in the hallways but pretty poor in the rooms (but we were at the very end, so that may be why)","Look, I poured through the reviews on this hotel, and honestly, our one-night stay here was superb. The room was huge, super clean and SO nice. Comfy bed, great shower, etc etc. We had dinner at the restaurant and considering there are ZERO options around, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and all at reasonable prices! Nothing to complain about there. The minimal interaction I had with staff at check-in (with my limited Spanish) was absolutely fine and they were all nice. Not all smiles like you come to expect if you only know the US service system, but no one was rude or unfriendly at all.

I did attempt to use their airport shuttle service, which I was SUPER worried about because of the bad reviews on here. I think this might help people in the future on expectations and being super persistent:

AIRPORT SHUTTLE: We messaged the property (via Booking) to reserve an airport shuttle. We were given the A-okay and told that it only runs on the hour and our driver would only wait 5 minutes before leaving which meant we'd have to wait for the next hour's shuttle.

With our landing time, we had about 40 minutes to get off the plane, get our bags, go through immigration (and a second one at baggage claim) to get to the meeting point. A meeting point that given via Whatsapp. I would definitely say the exact location either needs to be changed or needs to be made much clearer (perhaps better translated?) because it seemed like the driver had no earthly idea where we were --even when we had a Spanish speaker call him, text him, voice message him etc on our location. (we were persistent!)

Anyways, the shuttle DID come 25 minutes past 7pm, and took us straight to the hotel. But without that Spanish speaker who helped us, we would not have known where or when it would arrive and probably tried to taxi. So with a better pickup location and VERY clear directions/instructions, I think it would be a decent service for people staying at their hotel.",10.0,November 2022,"December 10, 2022",King Room - Non-Smoking,1,Couple,8.8,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0

The location was great in it's proximity to the airport, just a short shuttle ride, though of course that means it is not a great area for a stroll to stretch out after a long flight, very much a business park.","Our luggage took a long time to arrive and we missed our scheduled airport shuttle, the driver returned to collect us when we WhatsApped that we were finally out.  The pick-up location was a little difficult to find,  the Starbucks mentioned being outside the terminal when we were looking for it inside.  The driver sent a photo so we could confirm we were in the right place, that was helpful.

Comfortable hotel at the airport with infrequent shuttle,This is an airport hotel but the shuttle to the airport only goes once an hour on the hour. The trip takes about 10 minutes.

Semi-served it’s purpose for one night stay but we could not use their shuttle.,"We booked this hotel in particular because we landed from Calama-Santiago in the evening and had an early flight out Santiago-Punta Arenas in the morning. We booked specifically so that we were close to the airport and the hotel included airport-hotel-airport shuttle for free. 

However when we tried to book the shuttle in advance for airport-hotel transfer. it was full and they suggested we wait 2 hours for the next one. To book the shuttle for our return to the airport (hotel-airport), we were told this can only be booked on check in. I asked to book early as we missed out on the shuttle from airport-hotel but they declined. On check-in, the shuttle from hotel-airport was booked up with jo space for us.

Therefore we booked a taxi instead, both ways, which made our entire booking redundant as we could have gone with another hotel nearby the airport offering the same service.","The room was great, bed comfy, shower powerful and we slept well.",8.0,September 2023,"September 28, 2023",King Room - Non-Smoking,1,Couple,8.8,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

it was inconvenient had to came back to the airport to buy dollars and more expensive, shortening my stay in the Hotel.

Good stay. Some things can be improved for better good value for money.,"I am not a Chilean resident for more than 10 years now, however I do travel with a Chilean passport.

"If you’re planning on staying at this hotel because of the free/courtesy shuttle, don’t bother- just stay somewhere","We booked this hotel because we flew in to Chile for one night only, with an early flight out again the next morning, so the included airport transfer was one of the main reasons we chose to stay at this hotel and pay a lot more money for this than another hotel a bit further away. However the shuttle was 30 minutes late to collect us and I had no response when calling and messaging both the driver and the hotel. The next morning we went to the lobby to see that the shuttle bus appeared to have broken down, resulting in us having to sort out our own taxis with other guests also needing to get to the airport. This was incredibly stressful given I was in a new country for one night and had been relying on the shuttle service; had I known it was this unreliable I would have pre-arranged a taxi. Whilst absolutely not the driver’s fault that the van had broken down, it would have been helpful if the staff on the front desk offered to assist us with ordering taxis and it would have been very good customer service for the hotel to reimburse these guests for the cost of their taxi (only around $7 per taxi) to acknowledge the inconvenience this situation had caused their guests who had paid a lot of money to stay at this hotel and were rushing off for flights. When I emailed the staff to request they consider a reimbursement for the taxi, they said the airport transfer was “not free, it’s courtesy so we won’t be reimbursing you”. This felt incredibly abrupt and rude; it was also incorrect, as they do currently advertise their shuttle service as free on the website (even then, I am not sure what the difference between free and courtesy means in this context anyway). The price I paid for this hotel was not worth it, and the level of customer service could be much improved.",Very comfortable room and bathroom.,4.0,January 2024,"January 30, 2024",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds - Non-Smoking,1,Couple,8.8,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

Fair,"... After what felt an eternity, we made it to the room and given the time of the day were told that only room service was available if we wanted food (perfectly fine as we could see the restaurant was closed). We tried to call room service but our phone was broken. (This is particularly concerning given that we had been assigned a disabled room - I don't even want to start thinking about what could happen in case of emergency to a person that is not able to evacuate by themselves and needs to call for help. Also, I struggle to understand why a disabled room is furthest from the elevator and the hallway had thick carpet that makes you sink in when you walk??? How will you navigate with a wheelchair?) So we went downstair to the bar to order - a back and forth in Spanish and English - only to find out that at check-in, despite what we were told, our credit card was not put onto the room...so back we go to the fourth floor to retrieve a card so we could pay for room service. But that obviously doesn't end there. Once back in the room to wait for the food, nature called so my partner went into the bathroom, only to be greeted by a used bar of soap with pubic hair on it, and dust in the toilet from the disgustingly dirty air vent above the toilet. When we complaint about it the next day the lady at reception apologised and told my partner it will be fixed – this was obviously a joke from the hotel as the lady didn’t bother to ask for our room number and seemed flustered when my partner suggested that she should probably have asked that?! Long story short, the soap bar never got taken away, housekeeping came and did a half-hearted job in tidying the room, leaving an empty beer bottle on the bedside table. In addition, the Wi-Fi in the room doesn’t work, and to top of all off, we got dropped off at the airport by the same driver than on the way to the hotel. One of the most disappointing hotel stays.","PROS: 

The room was spacious and close to the airport.

CONS:
We are not really sure why this hotel has such good reviews - we were definitely fooled by them. First, we got picked up at the airport by the shuttle and are lucky to have made it to the hotel alive - as the driver appeared to have been pursuing a Formula 1 career in his previous life. The driver ignored at least two stop signs ending in screeching tires and a car almost crashing into us. I'm glad I didn't throw up on the 5-minute drive to the hotel. Then the reception couldn't locate our booking - unfortunately no one at reception in an INTERNATIONAL airport hotel spoke enough English to communicate what the problem was (before the haters come at me - English is not my native language either and I do speak ok Spanish, but it ends when people try to explain IT stuff to me). ...",5.0,December 2023,"January 5, 2024",King Room - Non-Smoking,2,Couple,8.8,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0

I was only going to stay in the country and the hotel for 5 hours, as I had another flight the next morning. And they had adaptors but they wanted to sell them to the guests. They charge around 100 USD per night but they can't lend and adaptor for 5 hours? 

Since I couldnt charge my phone I asked if they could call the room at 4.50 am to wake me up so I could make the transfer. They never called the room. Luckily I did wake up, but they never called, when they said they would.

"Comfortable rooms, great breakfast, useless airport pickup service.","One of the main reasons to stay at this hotel is its proximity to the airport, but the free shuttle service from from the airport was a complete disaster. We followed their instructions closely about how to coordinate a pickup from the airport, sending them all our flight information ahead of time, calling the hotel to confirm, and texting directly with the driver upon arrival. Despite this, the shuttle never came. After 30+ minutes of waiting on the curb, we paid for a cab. An unreliable shuttle service is worse than no shuttle service at all. (Note: the shuttle service TO the airport was fine. Just don't depend on getting picked up FROM the airport.)

While a late shuttle can be forgiven, disrespecting your guests is inexcusable, yet this is the treatment we received upon arrival. When I explained the shuttle mishap to the gentleman at the front desk (Gonzalo?), his response was not to apologize but to invent various ways in which we - his guests - were actually at fault. Even if these had had any basis in reality (they did not), blaming your guests is not a good look. In the end, he explained that some people waited 2 hours for the shuttle, as if wasting only 30 minutes of our time was somehow merciful.

Stressful!,"Several things really messed up our experience. First, we tried to contact the hotel to confirm transport from airport (included in the booking and a main reason we picked this place) but never got a response. In the end we had to go there by taxi at our own cost as the driver of the transfer apparently didn't show up and got nothing offered to make up for that. Second, there was some problem with the booking and we got only notified during our actual flight so landed with a msg that suggested our booking was forfeited. We again tried calling but no response on either phone or email and we didn't know if we actually had a place to stay overnight. Third, the payment system was a joke as they only accepted credit card or cash in US dollars but then couldn't give change. Fourth, we booked a transfer to the airport the next day with the reception during check-in but next morning were told we weren't on the list. In short, very bad responsiveness and incompetence on the part of the staff really made this a stressful experience.

Poor,"The advantage of this hotel is proximity to the airport and shuttle. Well the shuttle is only available hourly and if it's full, you can't go on it. Ours simply didn't turn up to the designated pick-up point in the domestic terminal. After various phonecalls and a long walk with our luggage across the airport, we finally got it. The shuttle for the time we wanted in the morning was already fully booked. It is not a ""free airport shuttle"" service, it is ""a shuttle if and when we feel like providing one"".

As a consequence the restaurant was closed when we arrived so we ordered room service. Nothing arrived after an hour. ""Coming now"" they said. Afte another half an hour it arrived. The bill was padded with an invisible item we hadn't ordered. The fries were cold.

High-standard hotel but extremely disappointing issue with communication and pick-up at airport,"When I reserved the shuttle service from the airport to the hotel I provided two phone numbers, one from Chile and the other from my origin country just for WhatsApp. And I made it clear. The staff starting communicating in English, but then switched to Spanish I do not know why. 

When I arrived in Santiago, I followed instructions to the meeting point for the shuttle service, with a small mistake from my part I must admit. I was waiting at the wrong floor in the parking. However, I was wondering why I did not receive any call from the hotel driver. I tried to contact them with three different methods they suggested, just one more or less worked.

I had the shuttle service scheduled to 7:00PM, but could just leave the airport at 7:35PM - one hour after my actual arrival.

What happened? The driver tried sending WhatsApp messages to my Chile number, contrary to my instructions. He also complained I did not answer a WhatsApp call. I was baffled. How come he did not reason a tourist would just use a Chilean phone number just for internet and phone. As a foreigner, it is obvious I would keep my WhatsApp linked to my main phone number from the country I am from and not a temporary Chilean SIM. And he kept on 'justifying' that someone saw the WhatsApp messages and did not answer the WhatsApp call... unbelievable.","Pleasant and beautiful environment, comfortable lobby and room.

The room were not baby friendly, is missing a microwave to warm up the food for the baby and the milk etc. No electric kettle available either.  Lucky I'm breastfeeding. 
The bathroom didn't have a bathtub, is always nice to give a bath to your kids before bed time. My baby didn't like the shower.
The swimming pool was available only in the second day after 4pm and the hotel allowed us to used it for one hour only. It will be good more freedom with the pools. I booked the hotel to be able to use the swimming pool to entertain my boy. 
it will be good more transparency on the payment should be clear at booking.com o in the hotel's website. 
I paid tax because I payed with cash with the national money. I paid double tax at the end and 30% more money for the room. It was very annoying. It need to be clear that the hotel like USD dollar. 
The hotel doesn't accept the Visa Debit so it is very annoying as well because booking.com accept you to book the room with your visa debit card, it doesn't make sense.","The breakfast was awesome, for every taste even for fussy kids and the hours are very flexible so suits adult and kids.

When the driver arrived, he didn't even apologize for the delay and was extremely rude. Not exactly the kind of service one would want after a long flight!

When I arrived at the reception for the check-in, I was told that because I didn't have a credit card, I would not be able to be charged in USD, but Chilean pesos using my debit card instead. In principle this would not be an issue, except that I was told that because of this, I would have to pay an additional 19% tax. I felt completely scammed and ended up having to pay a higher price than I had booked for on booking.com.

"Poor customer service. Shuttle unavailable , hot rooms","1.  Advertised as free airport shuttle included. Shuttle driver did not show up and I was stranded at the airport as it was Christmas Eve night and no cabs or taxis available for over an hour. Their excuse was that I reserved the room but not the shuttle. However when the initial booking was made, under special note: I included that I needed to be picked up at 23:20 from the airport and a ride back to the airport at 5am for my next flight. I provided them with my flight numbers for tracking purposes. 

The hotel replied to the note indicating that I WhatsApp the driver to arrange the shuttle. I WhatsApp messaged the driver indicating my name, flight number, and provided details for the pickup.  I received an auto reply that requested the same information I just sent in the previous message. I re iterated the information in the correct format for their automated system and never heard back .

When I arrived near midnight on Christmas Eve, still no reply and no shuttle. I tried calling both the hotel and driver multiple times but they did not answer even though the driver status said he was online. 

I eventually got to the hotel over an hour and a half later due to the unavailability of cabs due to Christmas. With only the best case scenario of 5 hrs of sleep betweenmy flights this was now reduced to 3.5 hrs because of the shuttle not showing up. When I arrived, I got blamed for not booking the shuttle even though I showed them the email and message correspondence.

2.  Room was smoking hot. Due to the HVAC system being activated when the room key is placed in the holder in the room. The room was 27 degrees and uncomfortable making my sleep even worse.
