Outstanding,N/a,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Belmont Hotel Manila, and I can confidently give them a 5/5 rating. From the moment I arrived, the staff were exceptionally welcoming and attentive. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and well-appointed, providing a perfect haven after a long day of travel. Additionally, the hotel's convenient location just a short walk from the airport made my stay even more hassle-free.

We were scheduled to return to the hotel in September, but due to the sudden passing of my grandmother, we had to cancel our plans. The hotel staff were incredibly understanding and compassionate, promptly waiving the cancellation fee free of charge. Their kindness during such a difficult time was truly touching and greatly appreciated.

Belmont Hotel Manila not only offers excellent accommodations but also goes above and beyond in their customer service. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Manila and look forward to staying here again in the future.

Fantastic!,The hallways need to look more alive. üòä,"It‚Äôs a 4 star Hotel but with a 5 star service!! The staff here are very well-mannered and knows everything they serve; very informative.

Pool is at the roof top and is open from 8 AM - 8 PM daily. It is also a heated pool, I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs 24/7 since we came around 5 PM. The pool is kids-friendly and they also have a small jacuzzi.

We booked Superior Twin Room, beds are comfy. However, a pretty tight room. But for the getaway deal of 3,500 with 2 free breakfast. It‚Äôs not so bad really. I think it‚Äôs a really good deal, even after the pandemic. There is no bath tub in our room, just a small shower. TV is quite small, and there‚Äôs no chromecast; just cable channels of course.

Nevertheless, I still would give it a 5-star because of their great service. No hassle at all.

The 6th floor area where we were at had carpet stains like a result of dirty water drip remnants. The smell was so bad I worried about my baby inhaling the bad scent. They took us to another 2 rooms which was obviously sprayed with carpet cleaner and air freshener. Once the air freshener scent was gone, the moldy and old carpet smell was still there though not as bad as the previous rooms assigned. I am not sure if I would want to book again. The hotel reception area had that old moldy smell but not that distinct like that on the 6th floor. When we changed rooms, the attendant said we will get the new room keys from the concierge and they would take care of it. I had to call front desk 3x to follow up on it. The front desk lady said on the third call I made that I could have gone downstairs to get the keys myself. So after the fact that I was told that they would take care of the keys for me she will say that I coulsld have gone downstairs. They only gave me one keycard per room instead of 2 keys. That is my Belmont hotel experience. The cafe downstairs was good.

Bathroom amenities like Shampoo / Conditioner (refillable) etc where not filled up.
Water delivery for the day are sometimes laid horizontal to the floor carpet at the room entrance, where everyone walks over.

Great staff but this establishment is falling down! I do not recommend and will not come back.,"Booked the room 6/9/23. This is one out of the handful times Im writing a lengthy review on any establishment/service for two reasons, either excellent or just plain bad.
I guess you don‚Äôt always get what you pay for because for its price point, this is a rundown hotel. In Filipino slang, BUDOL IS SO REAL! I‚Äôm not sure why the other reviews says otherwise.
 Lobby is small and packed, can barely feel the air even in their hallways. My room greeted with hot air, basang basahan (wet rug) smell. Room size is okay but I can‚Äôt overlook the damp comforter on the bed, the lack of light especially in the bathroom (no, that was not romantic, first thing came to mind was it was intentional to try to hide the molds in the shower. I request if I could get a different room. They were apologetic, helped me transfer my belongings and all. As I wander and make my way to the other room, it was made clear to me that my original room was a representation of the whole hotel. All windows glasses were filthy with moldy water stains, you can barely see through. My new room was no surprise, the only difference was there was more light in the bedroom and air was kind of cold. At this point, I was already exhausted to make another phone call. I stayed out for dinner to free my mind from what‚Äôs supposed to be a relaxing night to a big disappoint. Came back past 12midnight thinking the smell is gone and the air is actually cold but nope. I actually managed to past out from exhaustion but woken up a couple hours later in sweat at the AC stopped working. At this point, there was nothing I can do that‚Äôs worth my time or their time. You just suck it up. You‚Äôre better off staying in the nearby hotels. You can pay cheaper for much better room. Spend your money somewhere else and save yourself from stress.
Sadly, staff cannot compensate when the environment is horrible. I cannot overlook the molds the shower, the awful smell and the AC that doesn‚Äôt work especially with the summer heat.","The location is great, close to the terminal and many other prime spots.

Facilities are very good but late check out requests was not granted so rate is in the middle.,We did not like that they did not allowed us for late check out knowing that we checked in very late due to flight reasons. Our flight going to other destination in the Philippines was rescheduled at night instead of lunch time so we badly needed the late check out as we did not know where to go and my Filipina wife doesn‚Äôt know anyone from Manila. We ended up waiting in Terminal 4 NAIA with a 3yo child under the heat of the sun who is her first time to be in a hot country and it was a horrible 6hr long wait in that airport and it could have been prevented when they allowed us to late check out even when asking two times and explain why and still did not allow us. Next time please consider this with other guests especially knowing that they came from an international trip whose body clock is definitely still trying to adjust. The experience would have been better if we were granted with late check out.,We like that we booked the family room but one room was already enough for us actually.

This was not the hotel's fault but during this time the hotel was totally uncontactable, by phone, by email, I must have called 30 times.
