The hotel is fine.,"I have stayed in rooms 555 and 561. In both rooms the WiFi was unreliable or nonexistent regardless of the time of day. My mobile is a new iPhone SE 3rd generation and I have no trouble in other locations.  

While it is great that one can pay the bill in cash, this benefit is lessened by the staff not having any change on hand. As Denmark is eliminating many currently legal tender notes it would be a benefit to international travelers who would like to get rid of old bills if the desk could give then change. 

The lobby/elevator music is execrable. Much of it is computer-generated, cookie-cutter, and of questionable artistic merit. Once in a while a couple of real and competent artists are heard but the rest is dreck. More variety would be better as would some better artists.",I do not eat breakfast.,9.0,August 2024,"August 5, 2024",Small Double Room,3,Solo traveler,7.7,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1

Pleasant and reasonably priced,The rooms are only cleaned every 4 days. We are more than happy reuse towels but with the hot weather we were having to shower twice a day which meant we were having to seek more towels and there was no where to dispose of used ones meaning they quickly piled up. The air conditioning was not the most efficient and the temperature in the room quickly became uncomfortable. There were also only 7 channels on the TV which was a bit of a disappointment but not the end of the world. More variety or the option to use streaming platforms might benefit people spending more time in the rooms.,"The location was great. Many great shops and restaurants share the street. The hotel is a few minutes walk from central station which made it very easy to access anywhere within the city. We arrived at 11.30am and were able to pay an extra 100DKK to check in early which considering check in was supposed to be 3pm onwards was amazing and very much appreciated as we were in desperate need of a nap after a long morning of travelling! There are great facilities including a gym, a shared indoor seating area with a bar and outside terrace which we made great use of during the nice weather.

"I will probably not choose this hotel next time, was disturbed by the huge number of tourists.","1. Breakfast in this hotel is for all tastes - both vegans, vegetarians and omnivores, but very uniform. The hotel offers the same breakfast every day, I didn't like that. There must be variety in the menu.
2. The rooms are not well soundproofed. There are many irresponsible tourists who behave very loudly and do not respect other people's peace.
3. Breakfast is divided into stages, because the hotel is big, there are many guests and not everyone can come to breakfast at the same time. There are 2 big breakfast rooms and they are also full of people. There are no places to sit down and enjoy your breakfast in peace. This is a big minus for this hotel. You can't enjoy breakfast here, the next table, which is placed very close to each other, breathes right next to your ears.
4. I also encountered an unpleasant incident - I finally found a place to sit down for breakfast. I put the plate of food and the cup of coffee on the table and went after other snacks. While I was gone, the food had been removed and other aunts had already sat down at my table. Do the hotel staff really not understand and see that there is food in the dishes and coffee in the cup? The food was probably thrown away. Why?
I was unpleasantly surprised.
5. The coffee was not tasty.
6. The TV has only 6 channels - the programs are not interesting, there is not even a music channel to turn on in the background.","1. Liked that there were gluten free and vegan, vegetarian options for breakfast.

A little boring stay this time - Hostel like not so good -  Comfort Vesterbro.,"I am not happy to come from a night flight and the main thing is to sell me an upgrade for my three nights, And nothing was in the offer but a bigger room.

Great hotel in centre of town,"The hotel was quite costly for a 'budget' hotel, but considering the prices in Copenhagen overall it still felt competitive. 
It is necessary to book a time for your breakfast, which worked for me as I was staying for work and had a schedule to stick to, but I would imagine if I was on holiday it would be annoying to have to be regimented and potentially have to wake up early for breakfast because of breakfast slot availability.
The room had a table surface but this was at bar height, and the metal barstool was not particularly comfy. So using a laptop and working in the room was not convenient - fortunately there is space to work in the lobby also but for e.g. meeting calls this was not ideal.","The hotel was fresh and felt modern, and the room was clean.

Disappointing,"I had problem by paying - any of my cards was not accepted ( I tried 3 different cards - 2 Visa and 1 Maestro ) from 2 different bank accounts ( on every of this account was certainly enough money and I was also far away from my daily/monthly limit of credit card )... Despite I used those cards everywhere in Copenhagen and I even paid with those exact cards in this hotel before, it was, not sure why, problem this time. The boy of the reception was also polite, but he told he will call his manager. 
His handling the situation was not ok at all and certainly not proffessional. He was rude and aggressive, handling with me like it would be my mistake and I simply didn't want to pay... shouting like ""we need our money"" .. and I had to be one who tried to calm down the situation... I was offering him to pay by cash ( they don't accept it ) or per bank transfer or Pay Pal.... at the end it worked per transfer... but the whole situation and his behaviour made me really upset. 
I'm travelling to Copenhagen on business every 2 months and it is the reason why I will never return back to this hotel. 
Sure, everybody can have bad day, but there is no apologize for aggressive behaviour in the hospitality area.","It was my 3rd time in this hotel, so it means with many things I was actually satisfied..

You are given a time slot and asked to follow it to avoid people waiting (which is not so bad again). The staff were quite mechanical, a bit rude, and abrupt.

Lastly we didn't have hot water on our first night. The water was warm-ish but not comfortable to take a shower.

"Excellent location, ok amenities.","- The room had only 2 small drawers for storing clothes if you are staying multiple days and do not want to live out of your suitcase. Plenty of space but no real dresser.
- Shower water gets warm but not hot and swinging glass door means you need to be very careful that water does not spill out onto the floor.

- Hotel advertised room heating/cooling control but when I asked about it at the front desk they said heat was not available yet (it was in the 40s at night already). I would have liked to use the heat for a few hours before bed.
- Walls are not very thick, I can hear the person next door snoring right now and during the day you frequently hear slamming doors and foot traffic. Not enough to prevent me from sleeping, but not super quiet either, maybe relevant if you are a sensitive sleeper.
- There is no card/print out to explain things (like wifi,  how the heat works, what time is breakfast available, etc) so you need to ask every question you have at the front desk or find the answers at various resources.
- Due to COVID-19 they said they would only clean every 4 days, which was fine, but they never came during my 8 day stay.

No minifridge/minibar in the room. No water kettle/ coffee maker. At this price point, it is way too expensive. Could be ok at 50-60% of the price. Luckily, we were there for one night only. 
Parking costs extra and is more expensive than stated in the message I got from the hotel. They say it is because the parking company increased prices just recently. Can't blame the hotel for it - Apcoa is indeed the worst parking company in Nordics. Parking was dirty, and the drive-in is extremely narrow. 
Overall, I will not stay in this hotel and will avoid this hotel brand in the future.

Bad,"It seems that cash-free hotels are becoming a common phenomenon in Copenhagen, something which I didn't know. However, extraordinary is that many of these hotels, including this one, don't obliged themselves to inform their future guests about this potentially very inconvenient policy in advance, before charging them. In fact, even in the very long welcoming message from this hotel after payment, you cannot find anything about this important piece of information. So, I arrived in this hotel around 11 am on 18th October 2023, and asked the young lady at the information desk whether there was any chance for me to check in sooner (I was really tired, and because of my recent low back discopathy, I really needed to rest after a long journey...). I was also interested in paying for breakfast, which should have paid at the time of arrival. She told me that the room was not available, as it was being cleaned, but it would possibly be ready after a while, but I had to pay a 100 DKK fee, which I knew. I informed her that I didn't have credit card, so I would pay by cash. At this time I realised that they didn't accept cash. I asked her if it was possible that my brother from another city in Denmark to pay. She answered that I had to talk with her boss, (who was a young white man in his late 20s or early 30s). He wasn't there at this time, so I waited for him and used this waiting time to call my brother. I was talking with my brother when he arrived, so the young lady found the chance to inform him about my case. So I walked toward him to talk, but he didn't allow me to say even one word, and told me in a cold and formal manner that my room was not available until 3 pm.",,1.0,October 2023,"October 19, 2023",Small Double Room,1,Solo traveler,7.7,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1

avoid this hotel,"we were greeted with the phrase: you can pay, you have this amount to pay ( nice welcome).

We do not recommend this hotel. It doesn't look like the pictures on Booking at all. They only have one type of room on booking, and the hotel has at least 3 types.
We changed 3 rooms because:
-the first one (506 i think) was very small and dirty (and when I went to the reception he whispered something... that there is was wrong with the radiator, but without any excuse);
- 2nd room (512) : was a bit bigger and looked a bit with Booking pictures but the radiator did not work;
- The 3rd room (509) was relatively ok, but not worth the money anyway. The radiator worked but couldn't heat up the whole room, so do not expect it to be very hot if you have the room overlooking the road.

Breakfast was quite good, but not great enough to make up for it.
