Very Good,I really hate how someone had a party there on August 3rd and as a customer I had my room reserved and you know your rooms are not cheap and you had no valet parking therefore I end up having to go to another hotel and park they actually charged me $30 to park there on top of I move my car and brought it back to my hotel which was you always hotel at 2:30 3:00 in the morning and you are still charging me $55 and my vehicle was only there like 8 hours I was very unpleased and I need someone to try to assist me with how we're going to straighten this out because I am a dissatisfied customer right now,I love the size of my room I love the comfortability of my bed I love the patio that I had but the valet parking that situation with that party really had a bad taste in me and my wife's mouth,8.0,August 2024,"August 6, 2024",Corner Deluxe King Room,1,Family,8.5,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

As I expected.,There are two restaurants in the property but one is closed many evenings  I think they should both be open so as to give a choice to the guests and they need to change the menu. it is the sane fir a couple of years.,I like the location as I can take the subway directly to the hotel from the airport.   There are many eateries in the mall under the hotels and a CVS and FedEx.  you can walk to nearby places BUT there are many homeless inthe blocks near the hotel.,7.0,July 2024,"July 30, 2024",Queen Room,4,Solo traveler,8.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

The stay was convenient.,"I found a few aspects quite dissatisfying. It's curious how with hotels, the higher the cost, the fewer amenities are included. Cheaper hotels often offer complimentary parking, breakfast, high-speed WiFi, and more. We were charged $55 per day for parking, and each time we retrieved our car, there was an awkward expectation to tip. Considering the high price, tipping should have been included.",The staff were great.  We had an issue with the shower curtain and in seconds it was replaced.

10/10 for the Hyatt Regency ATL - 0/0 for Downtown Atlanta,"scammers, Panhandlers and crooks on the streets.. (Not your fault)","Good day, I have been in the hotel industry sine 1996 and I am a GM with Sonesta Hotels. My wife originally booked our stay at the Fairfield Inn downtown ATL. What a disaster. Was expected to park 2 blocks away and walk through a war zone. Hotel was run down, homeless laid out in front of building etc.. We never even made it out of the vehicle before we started looking for another place to stay. My kids and I did not feel safe at all so we went on an opaque site and found the Hyatt Regency! WHAT A DIFFERENCE. The property was in excellent shape, staff was amazing and we had an amazing time. I am shocked how much the city has changed since my last trip back in 2013. The only negative comment would be the aggressive panhandlers that run the streets in the immediate area. There was plenty of police presence but at no time did I feel safe. My kids and I were hassled for money every single time we stepped out of the building. Sad, such a beautiful city has turned into what it has. 
I will definitely be back to stay at another Hyatt. We love the brand. Stayed at many Hyatt Place back in the day when my kids were playing travel hockey..

The next day when I went to exit (I had already checked out and didn't have my room key) the parking attendant asked for my ticket... which I didn't have. He was extremely skeptical of me and asked how many nights I was there. He was even more skeptical when I said one. I guess he took my word for it and charged me only one night ($30) but in his defense, there was no way for me to prove it. It was all a little confusing.","What a cool hotel!

After reading the reviews, I think I expected maybe a little more especially at the price. It was a giant hotel though. Very pretty and very clean. The small interaction I did have while checking out was lovely at 430am. I think the price was a little high for a basic room that we were barely in besides sleep. And the amount of homeless lingering around the hotel soliciting. Charging $4 for a bottle water seemed insane and there wasn't a vending machine to buy your own.  Other than that, everything was fine.",The location was great. Right near the Marta and CVS. We were attending a Falcons game and the stadium was in walking distance.

Don't waste your money rate 4/10,Everything was basic. The hotel super expensive for far less amenities. Cheapest breakfast was a continental breakfast and it started at 15 dollars per person. The room had Dasani water for 4 dollars a bottle. It had a note saying it was complimentary but if you reading fine print it was free for certain guest. Getting into hotel was ridiculous. We stayed in the road for 20 minutes trying to pull into the little parking area to check in. Valet parking was 55 dollars per night. Everything at this hotel was so basic and very expensive. There was nothing about the rooms that was memorable. Very basic bathrooms.  We could have paid less and got much more at cheaper hotels down the road. This hotel is overpriced and underwhelming. I would not recommend staying here. Too expensive to just sleep in. That was all we did. NOTHING was given. EVERYTHING had a cost.

Beautiful & Refreshing,The sway was too expensive for a small selection. No one told us about the restaurants under the hotel as an option. The gentleman that initially checked us in misinformed us on what side our room was on. Also I tried paying for my room in advance. He told me the transaction would happen right away and it didn’t. I went to him twice about this and each time he kept saying I was good and at zero so I finally ask for a print out and saw I still had a balance of one night left when I ask for it to be paid straight out. It took 3 days due to the hold the hotel had on the card. In the future I would hope there could a better explanation or options provided on how to zero balance out the room when guest ask for this. All the other staff were amazing & professional. Thank you for an amazing stay!,"I love the location, and cleanliness.

"Excellent accommodations with easy parking, dining, and entertainment options in area","The booking originally inclined us to believe there was a bathtub but there was only a shower. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable but was also an adjoining room which we were not aware of prior. This didn't negatively impact the trip no more than staying during any event as such would do, but in the case of privacy or intimacy concerns it could pose an issue comparable to other offerings. Engineering was also sent to our room in error at one point and attempted to open the door unannounced with no notice from the front desk which was very awkward and somewhat unsettling. I did find it hard at times to reach guest services as well, but this again, could be expected during peak event times. Parking was also full and when calling prior to confirm we were not advised of the same affiliated parking locations that had shuttle services that we were notified of upon checking in. This could have been remedied by the staff when inquiring upon our call prior to checking in, but the numerous locations close by made it easy to circumvent. Overall none of these critiques would impact my recommendation or choice to stay again as we enjoyed the hotel immensely regardless.",The location couldn't be better amongst the hustle and bustle of downtown/Midtown. Numerous casual and fine dining and plentiful secure parking available within walking distance. It was also very close to the event we were going to at the time. The available balcony also provided a nice view of the area. There were also two major events happening on-site and the hotel was able to accommodate last minute booking.,9.0,February 2023,"February 20, 2023",Executive Suite with Balcony,1,Couple,8.5,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1

The Hyatt Regency is definitely with a visit. It is value for money.,"- It seems they made Hyatt's entrance a pickup point for Uber. It was nice for us, but at one stage it was so busy with Ubers, that there was a queue waiting to drive into the Hyatt.
- They didn't have any options for transport to and from the Airport.
- They say they have Netflix and streaming options, but it still requires you to connect to it with your accounts via your phone. They use Chromecast. Would be nice if they had their own packages for people who do not own streaming accounts.
- Downtown was nice and close to a lot of attractions, but my wife and I felt a bit uncomfortable walking in the area. We didn't feel unsafe though. A lot of people asked us for money when we walked to places and some would curse us if we refuse. That is not the fault of the hotel, it's the neighborhood.","Our stay at the Hyatt was very good. Here was what we thought:
- The bedroom was quiet and very spacious. 
- The bed was big and very comfy.
- The room was cleaned properly every day.
- The toiletries and coffee corner were replenished daily.
- It is a very beautiful hotel. I wouldn't recommend the elevators for someone with a fear of heights though 😅
- I loved how the hotel was connected to the underground restaurants and shops from the lobby area of the hotel. You don't even need to exit the building to get fast food.

Great if the night manager wasn’t there,"I booked two rooms over a month ago and called a week before check in to ensure the rooms would be close together and was told that they would. When I get there we are 4 floors apart the manager at night basically told me there was nothing that she can do. She wasn’t very caring, to the point that I wanted to cancel my room.  The next day I talked to Ms Yvette and she made everything right. When we went to check in the young lady had to move us to another room for whatever reason. This room was semi clean and had used adult novelties wrappers with dust on it showing that it’s been there for awhile. Went down stairs to talk to management which she was with a customer at the time. When she was done I asked to speak with her, she look at me and said “ what do you want “, shocked, I showed her the pictures and she said that’s a house keeping problem it has nothing to do with me. Told me I would get a call from them that night. Didn’t offer to fix anything. She would make it to where I wouldn’t book there again",The location was good very close to everything we wanted to do.

I waited half an hour for maintenance and decided I would go back to the check in myself. There were many unoccupied rooms so I gathered my belongings, went to the check in counter and they gave me another room. 

We went to 22 Story's and ordered the local meats and cheeses... I don't know what was local besides the dips but I didn't mind. What I minded was the smoked gouda and Swiss was moldy. We sent it back and everything was shifted only to find the same moldy gouda. When brought to the attention of someone in the back they tried to tell me it's the rind they cut off so I showed them closer and it was quickly taken from me and the rude woman never said another word.

"The hotel overall was nice, but my room did not meet my expectations.","While valet with unlimited in/out privileges is great, at $55 per night, the price can add up quickly.   My particular room in the Regency Tower was very small and felt wedged in a corner between the ice maker and elevators. Hence its irregular shape and its location made this room susceptible to more noise than usual.   The room was dated and just felt dingy, from the wardrobe that was small and made the little area between the bathroom and part of the room where the bed felt cramped.   The bathroom was tiny, and the plastic tiles on the wall and tiles on the floor were dingy.   The weird frosted glass window opening with shelves was nice, but it was just odd having it next to the bed.    

The bed was hard in my opinion, and the room felt very stuffy despite turning down the thermostat and ensuring the fan was on and circulating.","The gala was at the Hyatt Regency, so it was helpful to stay onsite; Peachtree Center is a central location.

Frist started on the morning of the 22nd my anniversary.
I made reservations for the Hyatt for one purpose that was to eat at the Polaris. I made the stay reservations only to find out later there was no availability to the Polaris. I attempted  to contact both Booking and the Hyatt to cancel stay. They both refused to cancel  and was going to charge me 200 regardless I am now hostage of Booking.com and Hyatt.
We arrived to check-in . Pull into the valet area the tenant stated we don’t valet your vehicle. I was told to pull to parking deck in the rear. So we unloaded to our room, I then pulled to the back. When I arrived  to the back there was a sign that stated 7' clearance. The door opens the clearance now states  6'6"". I will not clear this. I am driving a 4x4 F250 super duty. I then go to the valet and ask where I could park mind you there was an area behind a cop car in the front that I could have utilized to parked over night since the cop car was there for the entire night but however I was instructed by the valet the following. Pulled out then go to left. At light take a left, lot down on the right. So I paid to park overnight in this lot only to be broken into. This was the most costly and unfortunate anniversary yet in 30 years.
Stay 200.00 was to have a corner room with the view of the city instead it was view of buildings.

Poor,"The experience I had at this hotel for my birthday was a complete letdown. From the moment I arrived, disappointment was the theme of the day. The room I had initially booked was suddenly ""unavailable,"" which I reluctantly accepted. But as if that wasn't enough, the room we were given in exchange lacked the promised Chromecast – a feature that had been heavily advertised in their guides and on the TV. So much for using the screen mirror function. The live channels were trash, no games. Adding to the misery, the air conditioning in the room proved to be yet another source of frustration. On a night that should have been about rest and celebration, I found myself waking up in a pool of sweat due to the malfunctioning AC.

 But wait, it gets better (or worse). The room service, which conveniently claimed to be ""closed"" for basic requests like extra towels, magically sprang to life for anything you were willing to shell out money for from their restaurant. This blatant disregard for the simplest guest needs left me not only frustrated but utterly disillusioned.

The valet service turned out to be a waste of time and money. Gone were the hopes of the usual convenience where you could simply request your car from your room through a call or text. Instead, this hotel had me trudging down to the basement and deal with a cashier every time I needed my car (cashiers were nice!). Not once, but twice, I found myself in a situation where the valet was seemingly MIA, leaving me to wonder if they had any clue about their own service. When the car finally arrived, it was speeding around the corner like a cameo from a Fast 5 movie.
Even the shared microwave in the market area managed to embody the hotel's overall lack of care. When I dared to inquire about the possibility of other microwaves, the staff responded with baffling uncertainty. If you're just looking for a place to sleep that's close to downtown, this is it.

Avoid this hotel.,"With it being our honeymoon, we decided to upgrade to a king room with a balcony upon arrival (don't bother, the balcony is a stone plank with no place to sit). Our room had an adjoining room which we thought was a bit strange and unfortunately meant that we were awake all night while they had a party and smoked weed which filtered really strongly onto our side. The next morning I asked reception for a room move. They said it wasn't as simple as that and they would need me to go with security up to the problem room for an inspection to prove that what I was saying was true. I  said I really didn't want any trouble and would rather just move rooms. I was told they are a busy hotel and they couldn't give me the equivalent room. I said that was ok and we would accept our original pre-upgraded room and a reimbursement of the difference - to which I was told 'I can't see why we would be reimbursing you for anything, its you who is asking to move...'. I couldn't believe it. We finally agreed on an afternoon move to a smaller room but when we came to reception in the afternoon to get the key, we had to start all over again as the original person had forgotten to put any notes on our file. We were eventually relocated to a room which was poor to say the least - the 'balcony' looked into 2 other rooms and over the car port so you get all the noise of cars pulling up to pick up/drop people off, the smoke alarm went off every time we had a shower because the bathroom fan didn't work and we received several phone calls about room service we didn't order. 

The restaurant is filthy and service is the slowest I've ever seen (we waited 45 minute for our card and cheque to be taken before finally giving up and charging it to the room just so we could leave).

I actually left early and went back to kentucky instead of resting and staying there. when we arrived the room was still dirty and crumbs everywhere. the sheets were used and the bathroom had not been cleaned. Unfortunately i was on a time crunch and had to get dressed quickly. My friend took a shower and the shower was stomped up. we left and came back 6 hours later there was still water in the tub. I called and it took the person over an hour for them to come and fix it. Also i paid for valet parking and they lost my car. took them over thirty minutes to find it. this was my worst experience ever at a hotel. i would like partial if not all my payment back.,,1.0,October 2021,"October 19, 2021",Double Room with Two Double Beds,1,Group,8.5,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

The bathroom wall is of opaque glass that is linked to the room. When the light is on at the bathroom the whole room is litten up so it's uncomfortable if you want to use the bathroom at night and not wake the other person up.

Staff seems that has no common sense and communication across the departments within hotel is poor. I’ve extended to second day just because I didn’t want to wake up to check out - so I’ve booked another day early morning. Left a message that no one followed up with therefore at noon I was told to go down to lobby and recheck in. Which I didn’t go, stayed straight in the room until security officer came banging on the door at 3 pm asking me very sarcastically was I planing to check out today or no. Upon me telling me that I have extended another day he waved little manifest saying it’s nothing there and apologized. To little to late the approach was wrong and had it been better communication between staff this would not have happened. Overall decent hotel - NOT WORTH 750$ for 2 nights. Dated too. Oh YES!

The room itself had no reading lamps close to the bed (the only lamp was on a desk at the far end of the room). In fact on the left side of the bed that wasn't a light at all.  I couldn't read in bed.  The standing lamp which was next to the chair didn't switch on with the switch which was on the floor and had to turned on by plugging and unplugging it.  The under sheet on the bed wasn't the right size and I had to keep trying to tuck it in at the head of the bed.  While the bathroom was nicely laid out with plenty of nice amenities, the floor was dirty and had small tufts of hair on it.

Good,"1 day before check in, our member made a call to hotel for confirmation, we provided booking number to hotel’s staff and they replied there had no booking like that. We were trully confused and worried, we tried to call to the phone number given on booking but no one pick up the phone, trying to explain to hotel but they insisted our booking was not availabe. Then we had to get our friends living Atlanta came to hotel to check directly and our booking is valid, We don’t know why checking information via phone is invalid but coming directly works. It extremely takes time? I have no idea in case we have no friend in Atlanta to help us how we can make sure our booking is right.",,7.0,May 2022,"June 3, 2022",King Room with Balcony,5,Group,8.5,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
