3) coffee, tea, kettle? ANYTHING to make a beverage?
4) the breakfast looked very sad. Who eats like that in Rome?

However the rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff was incredibly attentive to my needs including accommodating my request for an electric tea kettle and extra towels. Best of all there are double windows so when shut, the room is practically sound proof. The AC worked very well.

False advertisement,"Nice location for a short stay in Rome, smiling staff, and....and the ""pros"" stop here. 
Now the ""cons""! In contrast to what's advertised, it's' not only a 3-star hotel, IMHO it's hardly a one star hotel.
We ordered 3 rooms that were, and still are, as of today, advertised with safe, telephone, toiletries, minibar, key-card access, fridge.
One room had no safe, in the other two safes were locked and unavailable. The explanation we were given was that they are in the process of converting to electronics!? Great idea, but this is not what was advertised and ordered!
No key-cards - old simple locks with flat keys that can be easily broken into.
No phones, no minibar and a fridge that did not cool.
The entire set of toiletries consisted of 2 tiny round pieces of soap and 2 packets of strange gel that we did not open. Not even a glass to rinse your mouth after brushing the teeth. No hook to hang you towel or underwear near the shower. No place for soap in the shower. No place to toilet paper near the toilet.
And the cherry on top - the water in the shower was constantly jumping from freezing to boiling - in order to shower you needed someone else to constantly play with the faucet so that you do not burn yourself.
And a ""cherry"" to top it all off: we asked them to order us a shuttle to the airport and the price we paid was 60% higher than what we paid for the shuttle from the airport to Rome, that was ordered for as by Sara from Principessa Trevi, where we stayed July 13-July 16.

A good and comfortable stay for travellers spending the day mostly outside.,A bit expensive for the price paid compared to what you get. We had a little trouble with WiFi although on the second day of our stay it was arranged. The bathroom is a bit outdated with an old hairdryer and also dull. The walls of the bedroom are some sort of cushion. The thing that I mostly disliked is the night lamp that was exactly on our heads. A hazard for sure as you bump your head easily. I highly recommend a bit of refurbishment as this hotel is really nice and it would meet its price for the stay.,"The location is great and easy to travel from. The hotel is really nice and even the style but I would suggest renovating the bathrooms and lights. The buffet is amazing. I highly recommend breakfast from the hotel. The buffet tends to be the same every morning with few changes in pastries. However it's a really good breakfast buffet that includes scrambled eggs, bacon, cold cuts, cereals, jams and many other choices.

Great Value,"They are in the middle of renovations, so there were a couple of things missing like a shelf in the shower, and the room safe wasn't working. (Which they addressed by allowing me to keep the items in the hotel safe while out). Those were the biggest detractors, though I would have appreciated more plugs in the room, too.  The room was fairly small, but I was looking for value more than anything else, and it was big enough to be comfortable while resting after time out in the city, which is all I ask out of a hotel room.","The bed was honestly the best I've slept in out of 4 or 5 on this trip, despite only being a twin (and me being 6'4"").  The pillows were excellent as well, and they provided extra like I asked ahead of time.  The staff in general was quite nice and was always willing to help or provide advice.

Loved Rome but will not stay in this area so close to the station.,The Madison Hotel is over the road from Rome Termini Train station which has its benefit’s but also this is a negative due to so much noise at night times. There are so many homeless people around this area and unfortunately some are drunk later in the evening and very vocal.  There are lots of bars and restaurants in all surrounding areas around the hotel. I hardly got any sleep as the noise continues through the early morning. Maybe this was worse being a Saturday but I would not stay in this area again. This isn’t particularly the Maddison’s fault but it certainly is a consideration if you are booking Rome.,Location but with concerns.,5.0,October 2023,"October 28, 2023",Double or Twin Room,1,Family,7.4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

A JOKE - TOTAL RUIN OF A HOTEL,"Staff were nice but pretty useless - room was dirty, floor has not been cleaned, bathroom was dirty too throughout our stay. Shower was broken - we reported this to the staff and maintenance had it checked out confirming it was indeed broken but no further action was taken. It was a disgrace and a safety hazard as the water coming from the shower was either freezing or too hot and it was changing without warning. The shower itself was also broken as it could be pulled from the wall?!This hotel is in need of serious updating - far from luxiourious, old bed with an old mattress, a hairdryer that you are afraid to use as it is probably 20 years old(or older). But this review will do nothing for you I suppose - as it is being booked constantly and all the time pretty full - but it is a rip off regardless.

Good location and friendly staff but the room price was not justifiable for the lodging.,The price for the room was ridiculous for what we got but this was probably due to price gouging going on throughout the city due to the Ryder Cup being in town.  Also there were major renovations ongoing on the floor above which meant coming back during the day to relax was out of the question due to the hammering and power tools being used.

Hello. Before I post a review I wanted to give you my review of my 8 hour stay on July 29.  The location was exactly what I needed as I flew in early in the morning and needed to be at Termini at 3pm.

The hotel transport. The hotel organized my transport from FCO to the hotel.  MULTIPLE ISSUES IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. 60 euros.
1.  6:03 am. The driver contacted me shortly after we landed at 5:45am. He indicated he would be there soon.  Dropping off other passengers.   6:35am. I texted him to tell him we had our bags and where we were supposed to meet him. 6:50am. He stated he dropped off his passengers and would be there in 10 minutes.
	1.	He showed up In a frenzy and said to follow him go the car which was a decent 10 minute walk with 4 large suitcases.  He offered to help pull  1 luggage and as we weren’t fast enough he took another.
	2.	He was driving extremely fast,and was texting while he was driving it was maddening.
	3.	When we arrived at the hotel he stopped right in front of the hotel which is basically barricaded by Vespas. Then a street sweeper was behind us to which the driver indicated to hurry up and get out of the way. The street sweeper was literally inches from me and my 15 year old.
	4.	The driver collects his money and takes off. Leaving us in the street. We could not get by the Verpas barricading the front of the hotel and there was not a ramp we could see.

Transport should have taken a left at the lights just before the hotel water there WAS a ramp.  He could have dropped us there to make everyones life easier that morning. It was frustrating that he was happy to drop us in the middle of the street with the street sweeper on top of us with no easy route into the hotel.

The hotel entrance has a verysteep makeshift ramp which is absolutely too inclined and made it very difficult to maneuver 4 large suitcases with me and a 15 year old

Some room doors didnt even have the key system in it. The carpet wasn't great. It's old, it's not welcoming and it's not worth the price at all.
