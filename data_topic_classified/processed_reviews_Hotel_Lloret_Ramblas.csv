"Fantastic location, easy check in, would recommend.","Just one thing, no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms.

There is also a metro station very nearby and plenty of taxis.

Perfect location and great staff!,"The window had permanent blinds, so there was no natural light coming in. I had to have all lights on, even during the day, because otherwise it would be completely dark in there. The bed was a bit too soft for me.","Location of this place is just fantastic! It's on La Rambla, so one gets to enjoy the closeness to this famous street, stands with foods, souvenirs, restaurants, La Boqueria and Carrefour for everyday needs. There's metro, buses etc. nearby (including the one that goes directly to airport). They can take you to the various parts of the city for sightseeing, as well as the La Barceloneta beach, which is fairly nice, clean and popular with the tourists. If someone doesn't mind walking, it's about 30 minutes by foot to the beach. 

I absolutely loved the hotel staff - so helpful and cordial. They went out of their way to make my stay there pleasant. On my arrival and departure day I could leave my luggage in the storage. They also have a toilet for guests, where people can freshen up at any moment, even before the check in and after the check out. They accept payment with debit cards. 

The hotel has lifts (very convenient!) and sort of a common area with a balcony. My room was rather small, but perfectly fine for me, because I went to Barcelona to enjoy the city, not to spend time at the hotel. My room was located in the furthest part of the hotel, so I didn't hear any street noises at night (except for other unruly guests, but that's not hotel's fault). 

Because my room was so dark on its own, it was great for sleeping, cos I need to have an absolute darkness for good quality sleep. 

The bathroom had a working shower and hair drier, so that covered all of my needs. I also was provided with three towels of various sizes and basic toiletries.
 
The A/C was working perfectly, which was essential for me, since I don't handle hot weather well. It wasn't even that loud and after the first day it stopped giving me a headache.

It desperately needs a lick of paint and some renovation/upgrade. I requested a double bed but was given twin beds. There is no fridge and no coffee-making facilities - which I should of course have checked beforehand. So all in all a little disappointing.","The location is fantastic - right on La Rambla, close to Plaça de Catalunya (and therefore convenient for metro and airport bus) and La Boqueria food market.

I would have been fine with the above should it have been a clean place to lay my head at night…however, the place was under renovation throughout. 
There were workers and debris everywhere, loud noice early morning and throughout the day. Worst of all, my room was covered in dust and I found some building rubbish in the corner on the floor so it looked like perhaps it wasn’t thoroughly cleaned.
The renovations were not communicated prior nor was the room discounted for the inconvenience. I feel like typically an establishment would close or otherwise discount the rooms for the renovation period.

Awesome location but entry level room was too small,"My room was extremely small. I might not have seen a smaller room than this, provided that I stayed at many places all over the world. 
There was a portable luggage stand, but when you use that, it really reduces your movement area.
The bathroom was a deal breaker for me and had a couple of drawbacks:
1. No door - not a big deal for me as I saw it in desc. But may be for many people I know.
2. The shower area (no cabin) was very small. You should be athletic and powerful and careful to have a safe shower in the designated place without leading to accidents!! You can easily slip while trying to move over toilet.
3. There was no hard door (most probably there is no way you can install in such small area), just a curtain like 20 years ago - No matter how you try carefully, the water goes out and it is leading to mess. 

I would definitely stay in this hotel but definitely not in the simplest room i stayed. In general, decent hotel with good staff.","Right next to pl catalunya and on most famous street La Rambla. Close to all.

"Great location, room, breakfast & staff",none.,"Location - located where La Rambla street starts.  We had a balcony & have a great view of the street with the trees & lamp posts; cabs run through the street & there is a cab stand right across the hotel.  I don't know if the cabs run through late at night or early morning.  The hotel is a walking distance from the placa catalunya, gothic quarter & passeig de gracia; at the end of this street is the beach; near shopping malls, pharmacies & foreign exchange places which make it very convenient.  There is subway & bus stop near the hotel (we did not use it so I don't know where it goes).  Despite being near a well-trafficked area, it was not noisy & did not bother our sleep.  An elevator takes you from the ground floor to the 1st floor & there is another elevator which takes you to your room.  It is a small elevator, fits 4 people or 2 people with 2 medium luggages.  Walls are thin so you can hear other guests talking.

Breakfast - we had breakfast there 1x.  It was buffet style, good spread of eggs, bread, pasties, bacon, coffee & juices.  Breakfast place was on the 2nd floor overlooking La Rambla & the great architecture of the buildings across it

Room - we were given the 2 twin beds we requested.  The room was small but had enough room for 2 luggages as we can store it right under the bed.  Mattress was firm & comfortable; extra pillows & blankets are in the room; a safe was there; bathroom with toiletries; good water pressure; we were provided with enough towels; there is a tv (we did not use it); no kettle or fridge which the hotel informs you on their website

Others - after check out, I was able to leave my luggage at the front desk & stay at the lobby which is a small area on the 2nd floor.  It makes it intimate & allows you to hang out with the other guests & talk.

Didn't get the room we reserved. Shower was kind of awkward. Staff was friendly.,"I booked on Booking.com weeks in advance and specifically asked for a room with 2 beds. My teenage son and I were staying there and needed more than one bed. When we arrived, they said they would not have a room with double beds ready until the next night and, in order to get that room, we had to basically check out of the single bed room, take all of our stuff down to store it in a storage room for the day, until we could get into the room with double beds that night. That was not convenient for us for many reasons so we just decided to stay in the cramped single bed room. The shower was also extremely high up off the ground. I am 5'2 and the step up into the shower was probably mid thigh on me.","Staff was friendly and helpful. We booked tickets to an attraction that, after receiving the tickets in email, stated we had to print the ticket.

Disappointing and claustrophobic room,Our booking confirmed that our room would have a balcony. However upon arrival we found the room had no balcony and no outside view at all. In fact we were looking into the bedroom of another guest. When we brought this to the attention of the receptionist he told us that “that is just the way it is and you did not request a balcony”. We explained that the booking confirmed that a balcony was already included and therefore we did not need to request this. He was completely unhelpful and just said “that’s the way it is and there’s nothing I can do”,Location was good,1.0,February 2024,"February 6, 2024",Double or Twin Room,1,Couple,8,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1

Cool place to stay,"We didn't expect the world, it was a cheeky getaway so we were fine with the issues below.
- the heater in the room is on full blast and you can't turn it down/is controlled centrally - so the room will get very warm. This is great for the winter but after a while inside you'll get hot unless you open the balcony.
- if you sleep with the balcony door open (due to the heat) it will be very very noisy all night. But that's why you came here, no? Barcelona clearly likes to party hard! And it's going to be very difficult to enjoy that awesome balcony without drawbacks like that.

As above these weren't deal breakers for us as it was a cheeky getaway. We came there for that kinda vibe anyway. The staff are very helpful so if we'd told them I'm sure they would have done something.","The room was spacious and fun and OMG THE BALCONY WAS SO AMAZING. You literally can lean out onto the main/side streets and can enjoy the hustlebustle of Barcelona at any time of day. Really, really cool. The room itself was very elegant.

Breakfast was delicious each day too and competitively priced. Decent buffet with Spanish omelette, all kinds cheeses and meats so we could eat pretty clean for breakfast before going out and having all the processed treats all day.

And now I will tell you what happened.

After leaving the hotel, I remembered that I had left a birthday presents on the table in the room (coupon for the spa and 100 euros). I contacted the hotel administration via email. They confirmed that the cleaner found my gifts and left everything at the administration. Also, she additionally found a sweater that I forgot. Over several letters, we agreed on how I could get the coupon, money and sweater back. I got everything back in two days, even though I had already returned to Lithuania. I am very grateful to both the cleaning lady, who could have pretended that she didn't find anything, and the hotel management, who were very helpful and helped me recover what was mine.

Single room with no window but bearable for one-night stay,"I had a single room on the first floor and expected it to be small but the fact that the room didn't have a window i.e. no direct daylight coming in, really put me off.

This is not advertised at the point of selecting the room, and I don't remember having seen pictures of this ""view"" on booking. Despite the room being renovated (walls yes but not doors) and decorated, this didn't make up for the vent hole ""window"". Despite that the bathroom and shower area looked clean overall, there was a bit of black mold (or residue) on the bathroom ceiling, overall the room gave a worn-off feeling. I was looking for an economic option for a one-night stay as I had an early departure next day. Honestly, if I'd stay longer, I'd pay 20-30 eur more and go to a 2-3 star hotel room with a window.","For the basic it is (1 star - so didn't expect much), rather OKish for the1-night stay I had.

A Japanese capsule room looks like a presidential suite compared to that ""room"".                                                                                                                            

The ""hotel"" and the ""room"" are really different from the pictures that they use to promote the ""hotel"".
                                                                       
I had to return to the lobby and argue with a useless dude... It took another half hour to get another ""room"" that was barely better after I threatened to complain to Barcelona's tourism board and to publish the photos and video.

Then, on the way back to the new room, I found a prostitute working in the hallway....

The next morning  I was in a rush and had to eat the breakfast which was basically a tasteless ""Spanish omelet"" with mostly uncooked potatoes.

My expectations were low but this place managed to surprise me and not in a good way.,"The room was like a closet- extremely small and unwelcoming. There was no closet or desk, just a chair, a safe, some corner shelves, an extremely small bed, and some coat hangers along with a TV from 2002. That's it. It was very cramped, without a fridge or any other amenities. The room looked like it had a makeover more than 15 years ago as most of the wallpaper was slowly coming loose, the bathroom looked like one you would expect in a crackhouse and overall everything was old and tired. The room looked nothing like the pictures. Even the toilet seat had nicks and scratches on it...

The breakfast was awful and if you paid €10 for it I feel for you. If you don't have it included don't waste the money on it. It was essentially just some crappy coffee with some croissants (which were at least 2-3 days old), sweating cheese and ham and some cakes which were out 24/7 (I got some coffee at 5 in the morning and the cakes from last morning were still out there enjoying the heat). The only food which I would describe as tasty was the watermelon.

There was air conditioning in the rooms but nowhere else making the rest of the hotel into a literal sauna which means it smelled like sweat everywhere.

Great choice for explorers that don't ask for too much.,"Unfortunately the cleaning of the room can be characterized as ok at best. The shower curtain needs to be cleansed or changed, and even though there was a disinfection sticker on the toilet, we felt like re-doing it ourselves after seeing the room's overall state.

The room we were given was really small, however for a young couple that's only there to explore the beautiful city that's not a big problem, and so it wasn't for us. We don't regret our choice thanks to the reception staff and location, but we wouldn't recommend it to anyone with above average standards on accommodation. However, it's a good choice if you just want to be in Barcelona for exploring all day long and you need a well-positioned base to crash and sleep.","From the beginning of our stay, we were welcomed wonderfully by the reception staff, and they were always a cheerful note to our day every time we would greet each other.

The location is one of the best for first timers in Barcelona. We were able to visit so many different sites and do many beautiful strolls around the city thanks to it. For a five-day stay (and 130.000 steps each), we only used the bus once for a round trip to Park Guel and the hop-on hop-off bus for one day as well.

"Horrible hotel, definitely do not recommend","The photos do not match the actual room. My single room felt depressing, it was tiny, with old worn down furniture, and practically had no window. The only window overlooked the tiniest patio, which was surrounded by tall walls, so it was pitch-black in the room even in the middle of a sunny day, so no daylight. The bathroom was so tiny, that if you opened the door, you couldn't reach the toilet or the towels. The air was stuffed and moist, and the room felt unclean. There was only 1 socket in the entire room. They didn't let me check in a couple of hours earlier, and made me wait until 2pm, while I saw other guests checking in at 10am.",The only advantage of this hotel is that it is located right next to Plaza Catalunya,2.0,September 2022,"September 17, 2022",Single Room,1,Solo traveler,8,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Well located, but cheaper than others for a reason","The room was a little noisy as it was close to reception (travel with ear plugs); you can also feel the vibration of the metro trains (I think this must be the same for all hotels on La Ramblas). Room was dark. No fridge which is tough in hot weather when you want to keep drinks cool. 

The disabled shower was a disaster for two reasons: one it didn’t effectively keep water in and huge pools of water went across the bathroom floor. 2nd reason, it had an open drainage hole, which I think with all the moisture, allowed a cockroach to get in. I couldn’t sleep knowing there was a cockroach in my bathroom so I spent a long time catching it. I know these things happen can happen in hot and tropical climates but it was not a pleasant experience to deal with when you’re on holiday in a major European city. Even though the staff were very apologetic, it tainted the stay for me.","I was given the disabled room which meant the room and bathroom were a bit bigger than I was expecting, to accommodate wheelchair access.

Fair,"The room was extremely noisy, the walls very thin, you can hear anything your neighbors do or say. Two nights there was someone on the hallway talking really loud on the speaker phone and listening to music, at 2 or 3 am. 
The room can sure need a lot of repairs, everything is old, the furniture, the bathroom equipment, some bathroom tales were moving. The first night, our shower head was so old it was just pouring water on us, afterwards we asked them to change it with a new one and they did, but after saying that they don’t see anything wrong with it. 
The room was clean only in appearance, there was a loooot of dust on the floor if you looked carefully. 
All in one, the hotel is a good choice for only one night, only if you re passing by in bcn and definitely not for a serious stay of 6-7 nights. The hotel is indeed worthy of only 1 star, but has the price of 3. 
The lack of a fridge in the room.","The location is excellent, very close to bus stops and subway, right in the heart of BCN, just a few minutes away from the bus station from de airport",5.0,August 2022,"August 20, 2022",Triple Room,7,Family,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Bad,"Our shower leaked horribly over entire bathroom floor no matter what position the head was in.  No staff to mop up or come collect towels we had to use to soak up water.

We opted not to stay the second night due to the fall risk of the flooding bathroom and asked for reimbursement of second night and hotel has refused
