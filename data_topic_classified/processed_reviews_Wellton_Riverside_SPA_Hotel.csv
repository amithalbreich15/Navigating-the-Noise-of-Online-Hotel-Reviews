Very Good,"The check in process. We had to wait in a queue for about half an hour. The receptionist was lovely and very professional, but it just takes really long. Also, the parking situation is really not the best. When you arrive by car, there is nowhere to park until you receive your ticket to the parking lot. We stopped right in front of the hotel, where you are only supposed to stay for 10 mins. As the check in process was very long and we got blocked by two cars, we needed to wait until somebody else got checked in to be able to drive away which was way over the 10 mins. You need to figure out a better system for parking. Maybe ask guests to let you know in advance  if they needed parking, and send them electronic tickets, so they do not block each other at the entrance, when they arrive.","The room was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable.

The good points heavily outweigh the issues. I would happily go back.,"The breakfast room - ample selection of food was ok though I tasted better in terms of food quality - not really a problem. What really bothered me was that the available space is too small for the amount of people the hotel can hold. Thank goodness it's acoustically treated and was manageable in terms of sound volume. Physically however, everybody is on top of each other and in everyone's way. Tables are much too close together (between 10 and 40 cm apart) for comfort. Hotel management please note - this is a 4-star hotel not a university canteen. I was at best uncomfortable and at worst feeling like I'm eating in a market place. I mostly left the breakfast room stressed out every time over my 4-day stay. This is not good at all considering that a good number of customers travel solely to relax. Please fix it - it's a real pity as everything else is so great.","The Hotel location was superb - just a couple of minutes from the town centre. The room was superb - nicely designed, clean and super functional without useless frills - there was everything I needed,  just the way I like it.

"Very close to old Riga, and airport connections, and the hotel's facilities are fantastic!","The only issue was the noise. The front of the hotel faces a main road, tram line and railway bridge so you're going to have noise until around midnight when public transport ends. I think this will only affect rooms that have the river view though. Another issue would be too many kids; it's a spa, so you come to relax, last thing you want is kids running around the coridoors screaming when you've paid over 100 euro for your stay, but that's a problem that is caused by inconsiderate guests rather than the hotel. Neither of the issues have impacted my review too negatively though as I can't falut a hotel for its guests and location. Everything else about the stay was exceptional and I would definitly stay again and have recommended the hotel to friends.","The room was really nice, modern, spacious, and comfortable. We also had a river view. The spa is great you get access to the pool, jacuzzi, and 3 types of sauna. It's well worth 20 euro (guest price), so make sure you check that out! We are even considering going back monthly to the spa as non-guests. The breakfast is without a doubt one of the best I've had in a hotel in Latvia the closest I had in quality and variety was at a Hilton in the UK, so if you haven't got breakfast included you should add it. I would add that compared to most of the restaurants in Old Town the hotel's own restaurant is actually reasonably priced, so I would recommend eating there at least once as you won't find many options for the same quality and price in Old Riga.",10.0,January 2024,"January 3, 2024",Standard Double or Twin Room,1,Couple,8.7,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1

Experience with the Wellton Riverside SPA Hotel,"I don't have any negative experiences. Perhaps, I would welcome a bigger discount for entering the SPA.","The hotel is located near the Old town, right next to the Daugava river. If you have a well-oriented room, it is possible to have a nice view of the river and the National library. Right next to the hotel is the Grƒìcinieku iela bus stop, where bus 22 runs, providing a direct connection to the airport (approximately 30 minutes). The central bus station is also quite nearby. The location of the hotel is very convenient. Just a few minutes by walking and you are in the Riga Old town. The breakfast was rich and excellent. I especially recommend trying the excellent cheese salad. An interesting fact is that during the week breakfast is served until 11:00 a.m. and on the weekend until 11:30 a.m. This is good news for people who like to sleep longer. I also recommend visiting the restaurant. Excellent food and drinks. By the way, near the hotel there is Ala Pagrabs Folkklubs, where you can try traditional Latvian food and beer. The hotel staff was very nice. The room was spacious and clean. I liked the bed very much. It is also possible to use the SPA center within the hotel. But that's for a fee. The SPA has two pools (normal and warmer water), one of them with jets, and three different saunas. The entrance fee for a hotel guest is 20 EUR for 1.5 hours. I definitely recommend visiting the lookout on the roof of the hotel.

"Old town , great place to stay.","The hotel is not replacing / giving coffee capsules and when i finished the capsules they didn't add them and i had to go to the lobby and ask.
i think it is unnecessary and they can fill the capsules like they add tea or instant coffee.
the bathroom wasn't clean and i found hair from the previous guests (long hair inside the bathroom)

we had to pay for the spa center which is ok but they also charged for the swimming pool which to my opinion can be avoided - they could give you the option to use the pool but charge for the other treatments.

in the breakfast the tables were clean but also with no cups/spoons/forks/napkins - you had to locate them and take to the table","The hotel is located 2 minutes from the city center , in front of the river and in walking distance from the main attractions in the old town.

The Staff was incredibly helpful and amazing from check-in to check-out The room was wonderful, clean, and perfect to celebrate a birthday weekend in Riga 

The staff was the nicest staff I have ever encountered at a hotel. They were always friendly and asked how our stay was going every time we walked in the door.

From the lovely lady Nad in reception and looking very smart in the suit to Mr elvis working both nights and days shifts a true team player and also the two breakfast young ladies which were very welcoming and always smiling.

all staff were amazing.

This is the second time iv stayed at this hotel as Iv always felt that the view from the front door is amazing from sunrise to sunset.

Can't thank you enough wellton for a smashing stay for my birthday weekend.

As a hotel manager myself in London it was truly awesome and epic being hosted by amazing people giving amazing customer service in all departments well done again Wellton Riverside Spa Hotel

Best sleep in the center of Riga,"Ideas for improvement:
Breakfast: maybe add some other type of bread, like bread rolls, or baguettes. There were only toasts. 
Spa: I think a hotel with the spa, should offer to their staying guests free dressing gown and spa towels. Regardless how low is the price, I would thought it should be part of the room benefits. 
Reception: we did our check-in online and nevertheless it took quite some time to do our check-in. Maybe something can be improved in the process. The staff, as said, is great, but probably one or two admin things could be done more efficiently","The location of this hotel is perfect for anyone who arrives from the airport and wants to visit the city. It is right at the edge of the old city centre, which makes it a perfect spot to start your discovery. The room were spacious and comfortable. The bed was extremely comfortable, I slept like a baby. The Wi-Fi worked perfectly throughout the hotel. 
The breakfast was really good, what I thought was really a nice touch was the area where one could get freshly made pancakes, waffles or any type of eggs. Normally this would be just the ""egg"" area. Also, a glass of prosecco, what a nice start of the day. :)

Ieva's customer service skills are exemplary, she made us feel at home in the Wellton. We would also recommend doing the free alternative (Moscow district) walking tour which meets at St. Peter's Church at 12pm, it was great!

As a regular visitor, I‚Äôm surprised the hotel has not saved any details about me and asks for the same information every time I come.

One time another guest was given the key to my room by a mistake and they came in while I was there. The hotel staff apologized and delivered a cheap wine bottle to my room, which was odd because I am a non drinker.

The breakfast here is not the highest quality. Last time I ate there it gave me an impression of a canteen with influence from Soviet times. During recent stays I prefer eating elsewhere although its included.

In terms of the rooms what I appreciate less is that
- the shower is in the bathtub which is suboptimal and the water pressure is a bit low

She managed to actually free rooms for us fast and efficiently.
As i am a hotel manager in London, i felt this was amazing customer service.

Overall the rooms 504, 507 on the fifth floor were amazingly spacious and clean, not to mention the view to the riverside which was absolutely outstanding. I also noticed how the building was maintained and cleaned regularly. Hands down, one of the cleanest hotels we have visited.

The location was just perfect as it was close walking distance to local amenities. Shops, bars, restaurants, and shopping centres to name a few.

The Spa within the hotel was clean, luxurious and peaceful, 5* in my opinion and highly recommended to anyone visiting Riga.

Again, I would like to thank all the staff that made our stay an extraordinary experience a one to remember. We shall definitely be back in the near future.

All is great except of parking,"- Parking is the biggest issue. They rent a few spaces in the underground parking of the nearby residential building. It‚Äôs good, but the only way to get in and out the parking is to call the reception and ask for a person to come and open it for you. It takes some time for the guy to come. Moreover several times no one picked up the phone so we had to go to the reception by foot, wait in line, ask, wait, go back to garage to park‚Ä¶ Weird thing. And it‚Äôs all for 15 euro per night. They also have another open parking (same price) a bit further from the hotel. But it‚Äôs sandy gravel (so the car gets dirty) and the guard there is not polite. Finally during our second stay there were no parking places available at all! So we had to park somewhere along the street.

Very Good,"My comment is directed more towards Booking.com than the hotel itself, as the hotel stay was satisfactory, albeit a bit pricey due to its proximity to the old city. Our experience began with booking a room with access to the spa, which we had arranged over the phone beforehand. However, just before our arrival, when we checked the booking app, it offered us an upgrade for an additional 1.80 euros. We thought, why not, for a better room at such a minimal cost. Notably, there was no indication that this upgrade would result in losing access to the spa.

Upon reaching the hotel, the receptionist informed us that our upgraded room did not include access to the spa. They explained that since the spa operates on a separate system, there was a possibility it might still show up as included. Hoping for the best, we proceeded to the spa, only to find out that our room did not include access, necessitating an additional payment of 40 euros.

During check-out, we requested to speak with the supervisor, Nadezda, who kindly investigated the matter. She clarified that our upgrade through Booking.com had indeed resulted in the loss of spa access. Although she sympathized with our situation, she could only provide printed receipts and advised us to contact Booking.com for a refund.

Following her advice, my husband reached out to Booking.com, only to receive a response stating that due to the upgrade, spa access was forfeited and no refund would be issued. This revelation left us quite surprised and disappointed. Our intention for the trip was to enjoy some quality time together, including spa relaxation, but instead, it turned into a frustrating episode where a seemingly insignificant room upgrade cost us significantly in spa fees.

Sharing our experience serves as a cautionary tale for others. In such cases, Booking.com seems quick to absolve itself of any responsibility, leaving customers to bear the consequences of insufficient information regarding upgrades. Our disappointment","The hotel is conveniently located on the corner of the old town. If you're arriving by car, there's nearby parking available at Peldu lela 24-26, Centra rajons, Riga, LV-1050, priced at 15 euros for 24 hours. The attendant there speaks English, Russian, and Latvian, but only accepts cash payments; card payments are not accepted.

In terms of amenities, the room was well-equipped with toiletries, bottled water, slippers, a bathrobe, and a kettle‚Äîeverything you might need for a comfortable stay. However, there was a noticeable scent of chlorine from the spa when walking through the hallway.

It's worth noting that noise from outside and within the hotel can be quite loud. Those seeking a quieter environment may want to request a room suited for that purpose at the reception.

The spa, while not very large, is adequate for relaxation purposes. Additionally, the breakfast offered a wide variety of choices.

Overall, while some may find the hotel to be pricey, its proximity to the old town makes it a convenient choice for those wishing to explore the area.",8.0,April 2024,"April 17, 2024",Superior Double or Twin Room,1,Couple,8.7,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1

The hotel does not have parking lot, so the hotel staff instructs you to park your car in the nearby parking lot (15eur/day). everything would be fine, but after going to the parking, a very arrogant old man says that there are no free space. But then we observe a situation where Latvian citizens (not hotel guests) get a parking space because they pay the FULL price (without the hotel discount). Once again, we appeal to the guard of the parking lot saying ""look, we see how a free place has appeared for a fully that person with full price"". The man's answer was ""there is no room for hotel guests - the parking lot is full"". I understand that the parking may be full (although we counted at least 10 free places visually), but it is a very unpleasant fact that the supervisor behaves arrogantly like this in the center of Riga. I will add that the action takes place in the evening, it is raining, it is freezing, and we are with a small child. Unfortunately, the hotel staff could not help us by directing us where they would recommend parking the car in such a case.

Very Good,"Pool area/spa access is adult only after 6 p.m. and you always need to book in advance. Its not open all day as I was expecting - this information is not clearly written in website or booking ROOM description. Because room has a name ""Room with spa access"". I booked a room. Call for spa registration. Only then I was informed that we can not enter with kid. As we traveled with kids that changed and disturbed all weekend plan... Because we had to go ir morning from 10 a.m. , spa is 1.5 hour limited time. And check out is quite early at 12. So you 30 min to run from spa, pack luggage and make check out. Its too little time. So either check out should be later, or spa earlier, or let families stay longer in spa in evening. 

Breakfast wasnt so fantastic, as mentioned in comments. No omlet. Only scrambled eggs. A lot of vegan options. But lack of meet/cheese options. Meat and cheese were not fresh. 

Parking was very expensive, 20 Eur per night. It wasnt mentioned neither. Very was away from hotel, incovienent to reach it. In other building you need to call special number, ask security guy to let you in.

Modern comfortable hotel with lots of positives but some attention required in some key areas.,"Bit of an issue with frequency of room cleaning which resulted in us having to complain twice.  We ended up having to ask for clean towels and loo roll and putting our full bins outside our room to be emptied.  Reception rang us and offered us a bottle of ‚ÄòChampagne‚Äô to apologise but it was  v cheap fizzy sweet wine which they gave us.  Nice gesture on the surface but just annoyed us further tbh and we returned it. You can‚Äôt charge food or spa costs to your room so you need to always have your bank card with you.  People in other reviews have raved about breakfast- we thought it was quite average tbh, super busy and difficult to get a seat.   Also butter at the bread/toasting station is served from a communal jar so lots of people touching the wooden spreader - put us off having any so we didn‚Äôt enjoy toast. 
Lady in reception booked us a table in the medieval restaurant but when we turned up the restaurant was closed - turns out it‚Äôs been closed since the Covid pandemic. This flummoxed us. 
On our last night we ate from room service.   Vegetables were raw - weird and not enjoyable as a chicken accompaniment. 
No milk in room gif having with tea/coffee.","Location perfect for walking everywhere we wanted to go.  Spa was enjoyable with nice treatments.  Our room overlooked the river which was really lovely - we enjoyed a glorious sunset view and.  Decent sized minibar fridge in the room and well stocked initially but not replenished. Hotel and room was very nicely decorated and bed comfortable - we had good sleeps.  One thing - the room was super warm so we had to open the window so a bit noisy from traffic.  This didn‚Äôt bother us but might others.

Tap water smells of chlorine, there is no fee drinking water in the room provided by hotel, and the only option from a mini bar is 0,3 bottle for 2 EUR (there is 1 bottle per room).

I wish I'd had the time to enjoy the Spa facilities... Might have to come here again!,"Well, it sounds worse than it is:
the car park is around the corner, about 50m down a side street. But to get to it, you have to drive around the one-way system of the old town. I over-shot the turning and lost 15 minutes trying to navigat back to the road that led into the old town. If you get it right, it's probably a 5 - 10 minute drive. The porter has to be alerted that you are going to drop your car off, and in the morning don't forget to let reception know that you are going to leave the underground car park.","Receptionist was excellent, asked me where I was parked and said ""ok, we've got to be quick so you don't get a ticket"" - and she was! Fast, efficient, friendly. Very busy place. Probably at a premium - and when you're only there for the night and can't enjoy the Spa, it's probably a bit wasted.

Top notch hotel. Staff and Location superb.,I like sleeping in a fridge so the temperature of my room could have been cooler. The air con wouldn't reduce it to my preferred heat.

Good hotel for short stays,"Before our stay was confirmed we had to fill in the online Covid19 form, but once we came to check-in at the hotel, we still needed to wait the long queue and again to fill the same form in paper - this disappointed us a bit. 
Also, shower doors were broken, water spits out of the cabin.

Ant mostly what we didn't like was that the SPA is excluded and costs 18 EUR per person which is not said anywhere during the reservation period. Receptionist tried to tell that it's because we booked a hotel the last minute, but if you check the room availability for 6 months later, the situation is the same. If you promote your SPA, clearly communicate wether its included or excluded before the booking is made.","A decent place for a short stay in Riga - location is great, breakfast is also full of variety there.",8.0,January 2022,"February 21, 2022",Standard Double or Twin Room,1,Group,8.7,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0

"Nice stay, but photos should be more accurate","The photos on the website should be more accurate. I reserved a Standard Single Room and I got a room that was different from the photos. Don't get me wrong, the room was ok, but it was not what I was expecting, so it generated a bit of frustration in the beginning. If you see the photos of the Standard Single Room, it shows a room with a big window (city view or inner courtyard view) and then 2 bathroom options (with or without bathtub). I chose the one with a bathtub, expecting that the room would be the same for both bathroom options. However, the room was totally different, with a tiny window pointing to the sky and it was completely covered by snow, so I could not open or see anything, making the room a bit claustrophobic. The staff tried to help and they showed me other options, but none of the other options resembled the photos on the website. Anyways, it was still a good stay, but as a constructive feedback: more photos should be added to avoid misleadings.","The hotel is nice, comfortable, and has a great location and great breakfast.",8.0,December 2021,"December 28, 2021",Standard Single Room,3,Solo traveler,8.7,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1

Definitely not worth it. They had no male lockers left either so my husband was asked to return to our room to get changed and given a dressing gown to wear to come back down in.
On our last evening we wanted to eat again in the restaurant before we left to go to the airport. We had already ate in it and enjoyed it. However the service was very slow and when I got my meal the fish was raw and in fact freezing in the middle. I spoke to the waiter and he returned it to the kitchen to be properly cooked. After waiting 25 minutes the food had not come back nor had my husbands meal arrived. I asked the waiter to cancel the order and we would just pay for what we had recieved. At that moment my husbands steak appeared so he ate it but I explained that we were in a hurry to get a plane and there is no way it should have taken more than 25 mins to finish cooking the fish. The bill was brought to us and the cost of the fish had been removed and a discount of 15% also applied however it was a big disappointment after our lovely stay there.üò¢","Staff were all friendly and helpful.

"Very comfortable, perfect location, worth the money.","Do not under any circumstances buy their over priced room service food. The price looks reasonable, but you get such little food and it was so bad. I ate it just because I had a deadline and could not leave but I was so hungry. I regret this because it gave me a full on headache for how awful it was. This is also the first hotel ever to charge a delivery fee for room service. ‚Ç¨3 to bring the food from upstairs so just order from Wolt, for better food. 

The bathroom was the worst part of the room to be really honest. The shower had black mould and the bidet which I was happy for leaked. The bidet has a separate switch which I did not understand but hey I was happy for it. The shower pressure was terrible in that room, but that might be okay because the shower barrier only encased half the tub which means that the floor was soaked after each shower.

The luggage storage was very big but anyone could walk in so be careful not to leave anything if value if you arrive too early and have to leave your luggage.

The hotel lobby had dirty carpets when we walked in which I didn‚Äôt mind but since it was the first place guests saw I wondered why they left it like that. They did have someone cleaning the wet snowy floors all
of the time though which was really good.","This hotel is in the best location that you can stay in, in Latvia.

Location: when you cross the river from the airport you get into the main city of Riga. This property is just at the edge of Riga facing the river so that you get a lovely view, and it isn‚Äôt busy. You can really relax here. Then when you leave the hotel, (facing the hotel) directly behind the hotel and to the left is all of the old town. With all the sites you probably came to see. To the right of the hotel is the main bus hub, just a 5 minute walk from the front doors. To the back of the bus hub is the modern city part of Riga. The proximity of the hotel to the old and the new is the best. Also, the bus to Tallin as well as other parts of Latvia comes in at that bus stop. Advice, if you take the bus from the airport, face the river and turn right you will see an underground path to cross the road. Do not walk along the riverside, there is no path to cross the 5 lane roadside.

Facilities: I have stayed in 5 star hotels that had beds that weren‚Äôt as comfortable as this. They should go into the pillow business. I honestly wish I had a picture of the beds. 10/10 for those beds. The hotel might be 2 stars the beds are 5 stars.
You get complimentary bottled water, tea, and coffee and the Wi-Fi is good. They provide slippers, robes, shoe cleaners, shampoo, body wash, soap, cotton for make-up and shower caps. They also have a bidet for the people who wash. The view is really nice of the national library and the frozen river.

Surroundings: Directly behind the hotel is Milda, a nice restaurant with traditional Latvian food. They have vegetarian options so this was amazing. About 4 minutes walk away is a Lido, which is the place to go for a full meal for ‚Ç¨5 for budget travellers. Everything is within walking distance from the hotel.

Staff: The cleaning staff are extremely nice. The reception staff are also nice.",6.0,March 2023,"March 8, 2023",Riverside Double or Twin Room,3,Group,8.7,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0

Nice hotel. Decent location near the old town. Problems with parking and using the pool.,"The parking situation was not great. I realize that the hotel is on the edge of the old town and parking is scarce. However, during the first night the receptionist insisted we must park in one of the city's distant ""free"" parking lots, despite there being several empty ""pay to park"" spots managed by the hotel right next to the hotel building (they were still empty at 11pm, and a separate receptionist later said she had no idea why I wasn't allowed to park there). During the next night, another receptionist told us that hotel guests should park in a ""pay"" lot just two blocks away (called ""Good Parking"" on ""Kungu iela""), where we could leave the car overnight for 15EUR (instead of the normal 40EUR nightly rate) if we presented a form we were provided. We approached the parking lot and saw a dozen empty spaces. As we pulled up to the gate, the attendant waved us in. However, as I showed him the form provided by the hotel, his attitude changed and he told us to leave since they were ""full"". We explained that the hotel sent us, and that the lot had plenty of spaces. He claimed that they were ""reserved for someone else"", though it seemed pretty clear he didn't want to let us park for the hotel's discounted rate, and would rather see if he could fill the lot at the 40EUR rate. When I called the hotel to ask about their supposed arrangement with that parking lot, they basically told me to try parking somewhere else.

Regarding the pool, they don't allow children after 6pm. We had specifically picked this hotel since they have a pool and our kids wanted to swim after sightseeing during the day. I understand a ""no kids after 8pm/9pm"" policy, but 6pm seems quite early. Since we spent the day sightseeing (as I expect most visitors would), our kids were unable to use the pool in the evening when we returned to the hotel.","The room where we stayed was massive; much bigger than expected. The hotel overall was quite nice, and it was easy enough to get to the heart of the old town.",7.0,August 2022,"August 22, 2022",Superior Double or Twin Room,2,Family,8.7,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Place is great but my experience not quite so.,"Although we had a Deluxe room, my experience wasn't really worth of that name. One night we came back with pretty damp clothes because it has been snowing and the radiators were not working at all.

Called the reception and they told me to wait 20 mins for the technician which showed up after TWO HOURS, fiddled with the radiators, and leaving the room with no explanation, not even saying bye. Ok, he might have not spoken english but politeness should be worldwide, nobody has come back to us with any report of what he found, we had to go (AGAIN) ad the reception to ask about what and if he found anything wrong. After all that, nobody gave us a straight answer.
Another unforgivable episode happened during breakfast: we started to bring drinks (you need to do that in trips as it's self service) to our table, so water, juice, coffee, cutlery before go and get the food. While we were just doing that (so there were FULL AND CLEAN glassed and mugs in our table), one waitress clear our table as if we were all done there. Incredible.

Mixed package,"The breakfast on the first day (a Sunday) was a shocking experience. Despite all the strict Latvian Covid rules the place was utterly packed, there was no table to be found. People were literally pushing each other to get to a seat. It was self-service, and people were cuing up, 10 cms from each other, to get to the food, which they then took any which way they could. I did not even attempt to get to the pancake counter, as the waiting time was 10-15 minutes there and you couldn't get through the crowd.
Next morning it was calm, and suddenly they had personnel serving food from behind the counter in the most hygienic possible way. The contrast was unexplainable.
I know one should read the small print at the bottom of the page, but I only found a reference (""surcharge"") that the swimming pool was to be used with a surcharge, with extensive searching after the fact that I was asked ‚Ç¨ 26 + ‚Ç¨ 5 (this latter for the bathrobe) for a 90-minute use. It included all the spa elements, but as I really only wanted a good swim, those did not interest me. I chose this hotel because it did have a swimming pool, but even the very kind man at the counter advised me against paying such an insane amount if I only wanted to swim a few laps in it.
I read it that the spa was for a fee, but I had never encountered a hotel that asked for money for the use of the swimming pool from its own desk.","I had a wonderful room with a view of the river and the National Library. The bed was comfortable, the room spacious with a good desk and a nice little table in front of the window. I enjoyed having my own kettle in the room.

Very Disappointing & Frustrating,"Communication with staff at check in was awful. We were at the hotel for 4 days and each day it was something different. First day no towels in our room and phone in room not working. So you have to go back to reception to explain and that takes time. Second day they didn‚Äôt clean room, there was no door hanger to put on the door outside. However we went down and tried to explain before we left on a tour for 6 hours. The reception said they would make sure it was done. We returned at around 7pm. The room had not been cleaned. Of course we had to go back downstairs to let them know. We then had to go out for about an hour so they could complete this. Next day we went on a tour and returned later to pack for flight the next day. We were woken during the night at around midnight with noise in the hallway. At 4 am there was a screaming altercation in the hallway with 1/2 naked women in the hallway and this continued till around 6 am. I had to get dressed and go downstairs because the phone was not working to ask reception to call the police. 
This was not a good experience. On checking out later in the morning one of the managers did come over to talk to us and apologize while we were waiting for the taxi to the airport. I hope that they do some staff training to improve. Considering this is classified as a 5 star hotel and has a 5 star rating on the booking.com site. I would expect a higher quality of service to tourists. Would I recommend this hotel. I‚Äôm not sure. They need the tourism so I would hope they really fix some of the staff issues and then figure out better maintenance in the rooms.","The location of the property was great.

"Would stay again, but room for improvement","When we arrived, 3 employees were talking to each other behind the desk, but no one even acknowledged us. Not very welcoming. We had requested separate beds, but when we arrived (around 0:00), we found a double.

He stuffed the 2-person fitted sheet under the mattress. We told him this wouldn‚Äôt do so he came back with a colleague, who improvised something that still wasn‚Äôt good but we really wanted to sleep. The housekeeper fixed it the next day. Breakfast was good but the selection of fruit (mostly canned) and the coffee was not, and the floors were sticky. The airconditioner was blowing directly in our faces, we both caught a cold.

Stylish hotel but cold rooms in winter,"When checking in, I had a feeling that a receptionist was not quite sure what he was supposed to do, so checking in took a while. If it would say that he is a new starter on his badge, I wouldn't have minded. But I don't know if he was a trainee or not.

When we opened the door of our room, it was freezing cold because the window was left open by the cleaner for an entire day. The temperature was below 0 outside, so nearly the same was inside. We couldn't find any radiator to heat up the room, but it was essential considering we had a toddler with us.

The air conditioner was not working as a heater. And there was a note which said that a radiator must be used in the winter season instead. We searched everywhere but there was no radiator in the room. We ended up wearing our winter jackets the entire evening.

Also, the room was booked for 2 adults and 1 toddler. For some reason, they forgot to make up the bed for the little one. So we had to call reception, asking for extra bedsheets etc.

For the first time we stayed in this hotel 3 years ago and then everything was perfect. It's the reason why we decided to go for this hotel again.

3) However staff was helpful, it's not the best place for families with small kids. Not very comfortable for pram, someone needs to hold doors for you. Obviously for disabled persons it will also be challenging.
4) Breakfast was okay and even quite fulfilling but I didn't enjoy pretty dark lightning, in the morning you expect smth brighter.","Room was spacious, standard.

Didn't meet my expectations,"When checking in I was given a key, and as I went to unlock the room, It appeared that there is someone LIVING there already. When opened the door, I met a very shocked, half-dressed man staring at me and running towards the door. It was very embarrassing for me, as the man that I met got very unpleasantly surprised. I felt so terrible, as I invaded his privacy.  :(
Both of us had the same room number written on our cards. I felt very ashamed and distressed.
Tired after the 8-hour flight, I went back to the reception to change the room cards but didn't receive even ONE APOLOGY regards the issue. It felt very unwelcoming and disrespectful. Like if what I just experienced wasn't taken seriously.
I was moved to the other block of the hotel, which seemed not so well kept, as the elevator was dirty. The receptionist gave me the card and asked in a rude voice: ""Do you want me to show you where is the other entrance?"" I asked her to do it as I had no idea where to go.
She walked me to the other door, unlocked it, and left. I went up to my room. Everything seemed ok, but I must say that the sound isolation wasn't proper, as I could hear people talking/laughing when passing my door at night. You could hear people coming back from parties in the inner yard as well (the window was shut). The room didn't have complimentary drinking water as you might expect. And unfortunately, there was mold, a bit of hair, and red nail polish marks in the bathtub.

After paying 118Eur for one night I must say that the experience was so unpleasant, that I have decided not to stay in the Wellton Riverside hotel again.. this was the first and last time
I've stayed in various locations in Europe and the Middle East alone and with my spouse when traveling for work or leisure, but I had never experienced anything similar in any 4 or 5-star hotel.","The location of the hotel is very good. You can reach all the sightseeing points in Riga by walking. 
For breakfast, there are many options for vegetarians and vegans, also pancakes and waffle stations, and you can get freshly baked eggs. As I was expecting, on Saturday the breakfast hall was full, but luckily the staff offered to have a meal in the lounge bar area.

"Great location, nice room, but odd policies detract from the overall experience","For a hotel of this class, some of the policies were a little...odd.

For instance the air conditioning is turned off from September onwards. I get that this makes sense in the dead of winter when it's unlikely to be needed, but when it's September and actually still quite warm (24 degrees with the heating turned off according to the thermostat) it's not the most comfortable. 

Especially when this means you then have to open up the windows to let the cool air - and all the traffic noise - in. And being right by a busy road, with the windows open there was quite a lot of traffic noise.

The other slightly odd thing was that as guests of the hotel - a spa hotel - you were expected to pay for entry to the spa. I get that massages and treatments would be extra, that's normal, but most spa hotels I've stayed in offer free entry to guests. Here it was ‚Ç¨18 for 90 mins, or ‚Ç¨10 if you had a treatment. So if as a couple you want to spend a relaxing few hours in the spa, the costs could quickly mount up.

With these policies it just seemed a bit 'Ryanair' if that makes sense...which I get if that's the target market you're going for: low-cost, no-frills, basic and budget - but I don't think that actually is the market it's aimed at, so it seems a bit incongruous. Things you might take for granted aren't available or are extra.","The hotel location was amazing, perfectly positioned by the river and the old town so that all the major destinations were just a short walk away.

The room itself was nice; nice bathroom (with a bath!) and comfortable enough (I'm never a huge fan of the ""stick twin beds together with a mattress topper on top"" approach, but it's pretty de rigueur these days) - the room itself was very clean and modern.",6.0,September 2022,"September 22, 2022",Standard Double or Twin Room,4,Couple,8.7,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1

"Take care of your guests before, not after they start complaining","1. Not sure if it's hote's or booking's problem, but our 9 year old child was not counted as a guest, and even though we booked a room with two beds for 2 adults and 1 child (9 years old) the booking confirmation stated there will be two guests, and hotel made a big deal out of that. At the end of the day the issue has been solved and did not cost anything in addition, the experience was not plesent.
2. There was a problem with electricity one evening - it just got gone in an entire floor for about 2-3 hours. While it is understandable such things may happen sometimes, 32 degrees outside, no electricity, no air conditioning, no ability to take a shower or charge a phone/laptop is not something you can just leave your guests with, even if you're trying to fix the problem. Offering your guests a clod drink or sending them to spa to keep them busy while the issue is resolved is what a really good hotel would do.

Location is good and rooms are nice but breakfast is below 4-star bar,"There were no towels in one of our rooms but after we asked about it they solved the problem. In one room the batteries of the door were empty and we weren't able to enter but they solved the problem. It seems that answering the reception phone is not a priority - we called 3-4 times before administrator answered the phone. Hotel staff (beside reception administrators) do not understand English. As an example, we went a a bit early to the spa area (which by the way is not included in the room price). The gym was open but other rooms were dark. There were no sign about opening time and when we asked about it from one employee, he just guided us to the elevator which seemed strange. We got the information when we asked in Russian. There were other situations when English wasn't enough. 

Breakfast was disappointing from the start. First there were no forks, when we asked about it, first employee just turned her back on us and walked away. At first we thought that she went to bring forks, but after a few minutes we understand that it wasn't the case. So we asked from another employee and she helped us. The selection of food weren't exactly bad but where it lacks was the quality. Maybe it was a bad day in the kitchen, but the general level of the breakfast was below 4-star bar.

Please do not advertise yourself as a SPA hotel or take down pictures that give the image of a SPA!",The service and catering were very good!,1.0,June 2023,"June 25, 2023",Standard Double or Twin Room,1,Couple,8.7,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Its real shame. I can‚Äôt believe you can do that to your clients every day.,"I have not received what I was expecting to receive. I was booking hotel just because it was a SPA hotel and I was very disappointed to know that my booking does not include SPA access. 

You offer of rooms which are ""with"" and ""without"" access to the SPA are not clear to most of the people! 
You have so many hotel room types and packages, people are not able to scroll all the way down to find that some rooms are with SPA access.
Here I made a video of how it looks https://photos.app.goo.gl/f6XtMtYAwXfqAktZ9

Saying that this room is ‚Äúwithout‚Äù is more important than saying that other room is ‚Äúwith‚Äù.
If I would know that I will not have it for the price I booked a hotel, I would book myself to another hotel. 
Normal people expect to have access to SPA if they order stay in SPA hotel and if some of the rooms does not have it, you should specify rather those that are without, than those that are with. :))) Otherwise, it looks like cheating. 

Furthermore, I was disappointed twice. When next morning I informed to reception about my bad experience I met understandings and receptionist informed me that she can make SPA for us despite we have another package. When I went to inform that to my partner, and we came back I have been notified that hotel manager didn‚Äôt allow to do so but you are ready to give 30% discount from your regular rate and that supposed to be good offer for us :))) Of course it was double failure then... Besides even difference in rate between room with SPA and without was even smaller that the price I was asked. 
Its real shame. I can‚Äôt believe you can do that to your clients every day.",,1.0,May 2023,"May 30, 2023",Standard Double or Twin Room,1,Couple,8.7,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

In short, if you book this hotel for the spa. move on. 

The parking is a nightmare to access, cost extra money too.  and it's even more a nightmare to leaver the parking and get back to the hotel to do something as simple and loading your luggage. Plan at least 30m for getting on foot to the parking, driving around (and fond back) the hotel. 

It's also not a family friendly hotel. we stayed on a week end and our floor was filled with young adults drinking and partying until early  in the morning

Poor,"There are too many rooms and therefore guests to allow for a comfortable stay in this hotel. Moreover, the management has no respect whatsoever for the guests.

After many fruitless complaints my wife literally had to go scream in the lobby to finally got another (smaller) room in an extension of the hotel around midnight, we had peak noise levels in our room of up to 78db. A german lady next to us (who had to get up early the next day) was litterally crying. Booking tried to help us as well, but they were told it would soon end and that we would get a free spa access and a bottle of champagne.

Nowhere in a hotel description or booking confirmation is states you have to pay 60eur additional for an hours swim (no there were any places for it anyway). It's not a cheap hotel so to add 60eur on top no way it's worth it. Wish I've read more reviews as would not have booked it.

When we arrived in the room, we saw that there was no shampoo or shower gel, well ok-there is soap, somehow we would get away.

Then we contacted the reception that we needed bathrobes and shampoo, at the reception I was simply arrogantly called by the manager that we needed to charge a more expensive number, but we paid 345 euros. what more expensive room to take, maybe the president ???

I don't think we will ever stay in this hotel...,"Unfortunately our stay in this hotel was very disappointing from the first minute of booking. The staff couldn't normally say about spa rules and help to book time. I was trying to do that two days and I couldn't. When we came - it appeared that there are now available places... Yes, I understand the Covid  situation there can be just the limit number of people but still - there should be clear information how you have to book it, especially when I wrote them many times and even called. 
Breakfast - it seems that they care so much  about Covid only in SPA...Breakfast place was crowded!!!So hotel will take care about your stomach. but not about mental and physical health...You can eat as much as you want and when you want, but you can not swim in the pool....at all....And the breakfast itself was not the best and the restaurant is not very cozy :(","NOTHING.

One of the worst hotels I ever stayed in !,"Rude staff from day one ! After checking in I came back to reception to ask for plug converter , and reception lady actually shouted at me infornt of strange people if I can't see that she's busy and told me to wait in que and there was maybe 15 people at that moment ...
next thing was the fact they didn't accept our COVID recovery certificates from UK , the hotel page didn't mention about some
Latvian form with Qr codes of recovery certificates , they didn't accept our PCR test which is last for 72 hrs, made day before checking in hotel , and for that reason we we couldn't use any hotel facilities like spa , swimming pool or even dining area where swimming pool was actually reason why we choose this hotel . Because we wasn't allowed to restaurant we had to go every day with the list of what they should bring for breakfast to our room , every day we was waiting about 40 min for breakfast delivery , and food was just cold and burned , there was family of four but they never bring enough amount of plates , kettlery or even food , always missing something and picture I'm attaching is a proof for that . I have to mention that for extra cost we ordered dinner from hotel kitchen , chicken strips was made of frozen meet and actually we couldn't cut it even with knife not mentioning that it was impossible to chew , duck was dry and my partner pasta without no taste all for cost of 45‚Ç¨, room service support bring me 5‚Ç¨ change but they didn't when I mentioned that on next day they say they can't remember and they didn't have any note about any change ....
Room service ... the stinky ladies who didn't clean the room
Properly , they left the old dirty Dishes fromPrevious day on place where we left them while leaving the room , towels been change just once in our 5 days stay !

You need to know that the hotel has two buidlings, one at the streetside (or riverside, how they call it), and one in the back, which does offer parking space and house views. Make sure you are booking the right room if you want river view or Pool (and/or SPA) - it seems to be a common misunderstanding - and therefore totally not undestandable by both, the hotel and booking.com - that Pool (SPA) is NOT included in the base room rates, and costs a fairly high extra price PER DAY.","As a very experienced traveller I believe I can judge well the differences between a good or not so good hotel. Overall, the Wellton Riverside was a very mixed experiences hotel. My biggest compliments go to the Breakfast Manager Anzela who responded very professionally, quickly and friendly to our special requests.
