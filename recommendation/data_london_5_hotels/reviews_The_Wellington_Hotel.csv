Location was great",10,February 2024,"February 13, 2024",Twin Room with Shower,4,Family,8
I've never met such accommodating people that made me feel at home. Chris and David were the best.,"There was no air conditioning, no elevator, and the room and bathroom were very small. They did help us with our luggage since there was no elevator. They also provided a fan that helped keep the room a good temperature. With the window open, it's best to have ear plugs, as the train is very close and noisy till about 11pm.","The staff was excellent. They went above and beyond to make us happy. The breakfast was wonderful, also. It was great to have a frig filled with all sorts of alcoholic beverages on the house. For London, the room was an excellent value. We were able to walk to the eye and a whole underground of restaurants and things to see. Excellent location and great Pub.",9.0,July 2024,"August 22, 2024",Luxury Double Room,2,Couple,8

If it’s above £150 you should be able to be there for 24 hours at least and get your moneys worth .,"£180 for one night, check in 3pm and check out at 11am is a bit extortionate.

"Excellent value and great, freindly staff - would definitely return!","Nothing that The Wellington could have done about this, but we did stay on one of the hottest days of the year and there's no air conditioning.  We were very fortunate that the room we stayed in had not had the sun on it (No. 16) and a fan had been provided so we were actually able to sleep pretty comfortably.  I don't know how that would have worked out if we had been in one of the rooms on the ""sunny side""!","This is a great Fullers pub in an excellent location; outstanding value for money, particularly in Central London.  The staff were all lovely and friendly, particularly the Italian man who checked us in!  We had drinks in the pub after going to the theatre nearby and there was a great buzz about the place - we particularly appreciated the huge screens as there was so much sport going on at the time (eg cricket, Olympics) that you could choose what to watch.  When we went up to our room we didn't notice any noise at all from the pub or surrounding areas, but we came prepared with earplugs any way. Our breakfast was included in the price and was excellent; freshly cooked and delicious.",8.0,August 2024,"August 2, 2024",Double Room with Shower,1,Couple,8

Good,"Be aware, you are in the center of city, near train station. Therefore you shuld not expect silenece during the night, the city never sleeps :). But the hotel is aware of it and in the room you will find the ear plug to minimize the rush, And if you close the window, the sleeping is possible...","Perfect location, you can reach all major higlights of London. Example of aold england building, you can feel the history there.",7.0,July 2024,"July 30, 2024",Single Room with Shower,1,Solo traveler,8

Good value stay in an exceptional area for exploring London.,"Due to the location, yes you can feel and hear the trains. Didn't bother us much, the services mostly stop at nightime.
No lift. Quite a few stairs to some rooms.
Airconditioning isn't such a thing in England, in summer this room did get very very warm. You can ask staff for a portable fan if required.","Fun little stay above a pub in London.
Location is great, directly opposite major transport station and very walkable distance to many attractions.
Pub breakfast and discounts is a big plus. It is a popular pub for the area.
Room was comfortable. 
Mini fridge included with some free drinks.",8.0,June 2024,"July 25, 2024",Double Room with Shower,2,Couple,8
"Compact, warm good vibes","It was hot during a heatwave, although there is a small fan that helped out with that. The room is tiny! Also there was no remote for the TV, but we downloaded an app and used that.","The breakfast was great! Central location, close to train and subway stations. There was a fridge, tea and coffee, water provided every day, and toiletteries. Clean, although tiny room. Living above a pub during the European football championship was very convenient to watch it, great vibes. Our room had no noise problems- we heard the trains outside which we got used to immediately and afterwards it was even a soothing sound! No sounds from the street or pub, but i guess our room was facing the other way. Earplugs were not needed.",8.0,June 2024,"July 25, 2024",Double Room with Shower,5,Couple,8

Good,"The climb up the stairs is a challenge at the end of the day but it's an old building, so not surprised. 
It wouldn't hurt for the restaurant staff to clean the tables in the evening. They were proper sticky pub tables which isn't appealing when dining and is a shame as there wasn't anything wrong with the food.","Great location in a beautiful old building.  The room was well appointed, clean and comfortable though quite warm being on the third floor. We did have a fan, which helped a lot.",7.0,July 2024,"July 21, 2024",Family Room (2 Adults + 2 Children),1,Couple,8

"Great location, friendly staff, brilliant breakfast, clean room would be ten star if it had aircon","There was no aircon in the room which was an issue as this week was hot and humid. There was a fan which I had to keep on all night but that was noisy. For a woman of a certain age, this made it difficult to sleep.","The staff were really friendly and made my stay a pleasure.

The room had great products, shampoo, conditioner, body wash. Coffee and tea bags.",7.0,June 2024,"June 28, 2024",Single Room with Shower,1,Solo traveler,8
"Great location, lovely breakfast, comfortable and clean.",There wasn't anything negative to comment on and we enjoyed our stay.,"The hotel is situated right across the road from Waterloo Station, which makes it a great location to connect anywhere in the city. The London Eye and Southbank are just a short 10 min walk away from the hotel.  
We arrived early in London but the hotel staff kindly stored out bags for us all day until we were ready to check-in. 

The room was small, but clean and contained everything we needed (kettle, tea, coffee, hot chocolate etc). 
We were very grateful for the bedside fan as summer finally arrived in London this weekend, and it was still quite hot in the evening. 
We had a really good powerful rainfall shower with complimentary shower gel, shampoo and conditioner, also the little vanity kits and shower caps came in handy. 
We really enjoyed the breakfast which was plentiful and we had a menu with options. The Full English is highly recommended. 
Again the hotel staff were kind enough to let us store our luggage all day, even after check out and this was much appreciated. All the staff members we interacted with were lovely and friendly. I would definitely recommend staying here and I will do so again when I next visit London.",8.0,June 2024,"June 25, 2024",Double Room with Shower,2,Family,8

Great location but scruffy.,"Very worn-out interior for example the carpets are very threadbare, it is badly in need of painting. Very scruffy and a feeling that it is unclean. My room faced the street which meant it was really noisy. That said, location is really good. Breakfast was great. And overall good value for money. Just very run down.",Fantastic location.

A brief but very enjoyable stay in the heart of the city.,"As previously mentioned, the only downside was the amount of noise but this is to be expected due to the location. 
The guest rooms are situated above the main pub upstairs; I could not see a lift so if you aren’t able to use stairs I would perhaps reconsider staying here as there are quite a lot up to the rooms.","Super convenient location, opposite Waterloo train station meaning we could jump on the tube to get about quick and easily. Also a good location for walking to and from if you fancied a more leisurely pace. 
The room was clean, fresh and comfortable. Tea & coffee was provided (good selection) and also bottled water and a small fridge (unsure if the items in the fridge were chargeable, we did not take any for this reason). There were also some foam earplugs provided which I thought was a nice touch considering the noise coming from the nearby train station and general city centre traffic. 
My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast both days, a lovely continental style buffet was provided as well as a menu with table service.",9.0,May 2024,"June 2, 2024",Twin Room with Shower,2,Group,8

Not overly helpful and felt a bit uncomfortable.","The location,  breakfast, the amenities, the morning staff, the shower. Archie, the dog.

Perfect location to visit Londen. Advise to eat elsewhere (breakfast and dinner).,"Despite the double window which blocked sounds amazingly, still loud noises from passing trains 4x hour.
Very busy and loud pub below with television screens everywhere - didn't feel comfortable going down or eating in the pub. I hadn't expected this from the information on booking.com.

Except for ordering a (good) egg dish there was almost nothing to eat at breakfast.

"Good, clean, well apointed rooms in a great location.",,"The Wellington is in a great location, right outside the entrance to Waterloo Station and so provides easy access for rail, underground networks, busses and taxis. It's also an easy walk across Waterloo Bridge and into the West End. The hotel is a busy pub on the ground floor with rooms on the floors above. Whilst not generous with size, the rooms are well fitted and clean have all you need. Breakfast is served in the pub and there's a very reasonable selection of options. I don't think there is an elevator to the upper floors / guest rooms and the stairs are rather . . . compact. It's London and therefore prices are not cheap but still very competitive. It's also next to an over-ground train line, so you will hear trains rumbling past - but I still had a good night's sleep.",8.0,March 2024,"March 20, 2024",Double Room with Shower,1,Solo traveler,8

Brilliant place to stay with prices to make you check twice!,"I wondered why we had triple glazing. Then the trains went by. Haha! You are right by the underground and train station. No it's not like you think really noisy but you can feel the rumble of the trains.However these lovely guys do provide ear plugs! Which is very thoughtful of them. My hubby is a very light sleeper and he said once you got used to the noise it was fine. He said the other guests made more noise in the hallway coming home than the trains do! If I'd of known i would have asked for a room at the front I think at least that way you can see the trains too 😊. It's not even a don't like it's just a ""I wish I'd of known"" so I could have asked for the front as we love people watching! No complaints at all. Nice place all round.",We have never been to London before and we were very worried we wouldn't find them. So easy to find.I loved the location right outside Waterloo underground. A few minutes walk to most famous landmarks and green spaces. The staff were lovely. The room was beautifully clean. It smelled lovely. Towels fluffy. Soaps in the room are so nice. We had a few drinks for free in our room fridge . Much appreciated. Tea and coffee were so well chosen and tasty. Little biscuits and chocolate are a treat 😊. The bed was so comfortable. The whole room was very nice. We had a nice meal in the evening. Breakfast included was very well laid out. Great selection to choose from. The cinnamon French toast with yogurt and fruit was delicious. I just wish we had longer than one night. They even ordered a taxi for us the next morning to take me to my hospital appointment. Which was very prompt and a very reasonable  price too. Will definitely be using these guys for my next hospital stay. I was very exhausted and Ill when I arrived and they took all the stress away from the stay without them even knowing. Thank you guys so much. I also will be coming back just for a leisurely break away too. There wasn't anything to worry about 😊 we just wish we could have stayed longer. I'm also thinking of bringing my five year old granddaughter for a long weekend she would love stopping here and we can review the family room then too. I am sure they will be just as lovely.

There was this green light up in the cealing that we have no idea what its purpose is, but it didn't bother to fall asleep (was just a bit of a shock at first when you turn on the lights and the room still seems lit by that.)","A lovely hotel to feel local. The rooms are above a pub, don't worry the pub stays mostly quiet. Are room was located right next to the street and the hotel is next to the station.

The breakfast is delicious and served in the pub it self.

Location is great cause you are at walking distance from the London Eye and the Big Ben. Which is a great starting point to walk to all other sightseeing places.

Highly recommended for a unique London experience.,"Though it's understandable, given the constraints of retrofitting such an old and historic building with an elevator, the lack of elevators and steep stairs may pose a challenge for individuals with disabilities.","While The Wellington Hotel in Waterloo, London, may not boast the opulence and spaciousness synonymous with larger establishments, its character and history truly set it apart. Nestled within an old building, the absence of elevators and the presence of steep stairs may deter some guests seeking modern comforts. However, what it lacks in contemporary amenities, it more than compensates for with an intimate and authentic charm that cannot be replicated.

Unlike some other hotels that may present standard A4-like rooms with a lack of character, The Wellington immerses you in a world of rich history and cherished memories. From the moment you step through its doors, you're enveloped by a genuine warmth that extends beyond mere hospitality. The staff, akin to a closely-knit family, ensures that your stay transcends mere accommodation, offering a personalized experience that's rare to find in larger, more impersonal establishments.

In a city pulsating with standard offerings, The Wellington Hotel emerges as a gem, providing a unique opportunity to steep oneself in the rich tapestry of London's past, all while being embraced by a hospitality experience that feels like a warm embrace from an old friend.

Despite the regrettable limitation for individuals with disabilities, stemming from the complexities of retrofitting an elevator into the historic building, The Wellington Hotel remains a haven for those who cherish history and seek a genuinely intimate experience. With its rich narrative and heartfelt hospitality, it's a place where every guest is made to feel not just welcome, but truly at home.

As a seasoned flight attendant who has stayed at countless hotels over the years, I can confidently say that The Wellington Hotel's charm is unparalleled. Its unique blend of history, personalized service, and intimate ambiance sets it apart from any other establishment I've encountered.",8.0,October 2023,"November 4, 2023",Double Room with Shower,2,Couple,8

"A very simple, nice and convenient hotel over a pub in Central London.","I was not explained that I was supposed to put my keycard in a white box at the entrance of my room and that it turns the lights on. So I had no lights in the room and bathroom on my first evening. I notified the reception and they told me they'd fix it when I was away, but still no light when I came back during the night. In the morning, the person at breakfast asked me if my lightbulb had been fixed, so I explained the issue, and he realised I might have not put the card in. After checking, it was indeed the issue. It was a tiny misunderstanding, so just in case, know that you need to put your keycard in that white slot to have light in your room. As mentioned above, the hotel is extremely close to Waterloo station and a main street, so it is quite noisy if you are a light sleeper.","The hotel location is great. Waterloo is pretty central and a crossroad of tube lines, it was a breeze to come and go. Very friendly staff. I tried checking-in a little before the time, and my room was ready. Bed was comfortable, room was clean. The hotel is in an old building, so the corridors look quite old, but tbh this is on par with old London buildings and for this price range, I found the room more than decent in this city. Breakfast was great, it's a mix between a buffet and a plate of ""typical english breakfast"" items. A very nice surprise! Loved that there was a couple of earplugs and bottles of water with the typical tea/kettle in the room. The hotel is on a big street and near a train station, earplugs is a very thoughtful touch.",8.0,October 2023,"November 1, 2023",Single Room with Shower,1,Solo traveler,8

However they offer 15 percent off food and drink which is good. There are lots of stairs and no lift so beware if you have a lot of luggage. Also bring earplugs although the hotel does its best with soundproofing. I do think the advantages make this an affordable and welcoming place to stay.,"For the price it was excellent.

There was a very unpleasant smell in the room on arrival, especially in the bathroom and on the outside corridor. 
The shower cubicle was very small,  and the hot water was very limited. The walls are quite thin, so it's quite scary at first when someone from the adjacent rooms uses the shower!","The location was very convenient. It's next to Waterloo Station.
The team on duty during my stay was very friendly and welcoming. Breakfast was very well presented and a good choice of hot breakfast to order alongside pastries and cereals, juice,  tea, and coffee. 
The pub has a lot of character.
The room had very nice coffee facilities with coffee bags rather than instant coffee, which was a great treat! The room had a nice wooden floor, which I prefer instead of carpet. The shower was very powerful ( just wish the water had been a bit warmer).
I had an issue with a very bad smell in the room on arrival, which the team assisted with as much as possible.

A room above a pub offering good food and drink and a comfortable bed for the night. Job done.,The room was not large but it was acceptable. My main disappointment was the lack of carpet. Painted floor boards are very shabby and noisy. The shower cubicle was a tight fit and a bit awkward but the shower was powerful and hot. The safe in the room is battery operated and two of the four batteries were missing.,"The greeting and check in process was simple and straightforward. The room is in a pub so it was not expected to quiet but other than the trains that literally ran past the upstairs windows and the buses and traffic on the main road outside, it was not as noisy as I imagined it could have been.
The breakfast was better than I expected. There was a breakfast menu with a number of choices (veggie and meat choices) including a full English, porridge, eggs anyway you want them and plenty of cereal and fruit juices. The tea and coffee was unlimited and everything was fresh. 
Our room was on the front of the building on a very busy road opposite Waterloo tube station. There was a little noise from the trains but not invasive. The location was ideal for our stay. We walked across the river to the theatre in less than twenty minutes. 
Tea and coffee, hot chocolate and milk and sugar in plentiful supply and we were told that drinks in the room fridge were free for us to use. There was even a Fullers beer in there.",7.0,March 2023,"March 8, 2023",Double Room with Shower,1,Couple,8

"Good Location, Nice Hotel could do with a little more attention to some details.","The bed was hard and my pillows were all different, lumpy and smelt strange - I think that they could do with replacing.  Despite asking for a quiet room my room was right on the road so the traffic could still be heard even though I had closed the window and the blind.  The waterfall shower was nice but as it was so small it was impossible to shower without putting your head under the water.  The main light in the room was far too dim and made it really difficult to see in the room despite turning all the lamps on (when the shade was down).","The hotel was really conveniently located just outside Waterloo station and was easy to find.  The pub below looked good serving Fullers beers and pretty lovely meals.    The room looked nice when I entered with a good sized bed (which I felt was comfortable), a nice bathroom and well stocked mini-bar fridge (complimentary).

Good hotel that needs permanent reception staff,"They need to have a dedicated reception staff.  The fact that no one is on hand to help you unless you're checking in exactly at 2 is ridiculous.

"Excellent location and breakfast, but warm and noisy","My room was warm and humid. I didn’t think not having an AC unit would matter in London in September, but my room was much warmer than outside. There was a table fan, but it barely made a difference. 
The wall power outlet made a high pitch continuous noise which was very annoying. I managed to block the noise by pushing a pillow against the wall. I have a recording of the noise if management is interested. 
This hotel is very close to a train station. If you have trouble falling asleep with trains passing or people talking down in the street at night below your window, this is not a good choice for you.

Worth coming back to stay here,"Room: the room was impossibly small and although it had everything, we missed having space to move around. Also it didn't have a minibar/fridge.
WiFi: not the best reception inside our room on the second floor. And the Facebook way of signing-in is a bit icky.
Premises: there is no lift. With heavy luggage it can be tiring to climb up two floors. Also since it's an old building there is the occasional odour and the interiors look beaten, especially the restaurant's toilet in the basement.","Here's what was great about the hotel:
Location: amazing! Right in front of the Waterloo station and a short walk away from the London Eye. Could not have been better!
Breakfast: à la carte! This was my first time ordering breakfast off a menu. Dishes look small yet are quite filling. And each one of them tasted divine. Croissants, scones, fruits and drinks are available on the side and could be had as much as one desires.
Room: the room had all kinds of amenities, toiletries and coffee/tea options. There were also biscuits and sweet snacks. Best part - they attentively replenished all drinks and snacks each day back to their usual quota.
Service: extremely cordial staff. We asked them for a bunch of favours ranging from storing leftover food in their fridge to sending a piece of clothing that we had left behind to an address in the UK and they did everything with pleasure. Especially the latter. Thank you Valeria and team!",9.0,April 2022,"April 28, 2022",Double Room with Shower,4,Couple,8

Great Little Spot in the City,The bottom of the glass shower door/ seal where the tray starts needed a clean. Radiators were difficult to turn down.,"The rooms were very clean, tidy and minimal. Furniture was very good quality and it was spacious enough for the two of us. The mini fridge items were a great added touch and the hot drink selection was a really nice. The staff were super friendly and helpful even when the pub was busy, nothing was too much trouble for them. 

The location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing with the underground opposite and Southbank is a great spot to relax at night. The road noise was to be expected but not actually that noisy, we were on the 3rd floor so we were above it. The station wasn't noisy either until 8/8.30 when a few announcements could be heard.

Great place for exploring London! I will stay again for business purposes.,Not the hotels fault but the way the windows are it means they are steamed up and dripping with condensation all the time. One of the windows wouldnt shut properly in room 26. If your staying more than a night or two you may struggle to unpack as no cupboards (didn’t bother us) . Tip if your a light sleeper this wouldn’t be the best due to train noise. No lift (again not an issue for us) and room on 3rd floor lots of stairs.,Fantastic location literally across road from entrance to Waterloo. Nice touch with complimentary mini bar . Bed linen and towels fresh and soft . Toiletries provided including things like sewing kit and shower hat. Friendly helpful staff.  Free breakfast .  Kept our bag (free) before and after check in !

"Unbeatable location, very clean and comfortable room!!","The noise is the one downside of this hotel. But I was prepared for it, and indeed you can't complain with a location right opposite Waterloo Station and plenty of bus stops to boot! Also, the double windows do help a bit when closed, though it means the room gets a little warm, but I didn't mind that as I hate being cold. I struggled with the noise on Saturday and Sunday night, Monday night was a bit better, then it settled to just about bearable levels. I think it's a fair trade for staying in such a central location, but just bear it in mind and decide if it's a price you're willing to pay (and maybe bring a pair of earplugs). Another thing was that most of the staff didn't wear masks. I felt a little uncomfortable, and didn't want to hang around the lobby/pub for too long, if I have to be completely honest, but at the end of the day, the positives outweighed the negatives for me.","Everything else was awesome! The room and bathroom were very clean (especially the bathroom, I don't think I have ever seen a cleaner bathroom, and the towels were really thick and soft!), and the free breakfast kept me going all day. The muffins, smoked salmon and poached eggs with hollandaise sauce were absolutely delicious! The bed was a bit hard, but still comfortable. Also, did I mention the location?! Within half an hour's walk from The Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, Houses of Parliament, and a short bus journey to many other places, it's a brilliant location! Also appreciated the free drink when I signed up for the free WiFi, and Jack, one of the cleaning staff was lovely and very friendly. There is a pub downstairs, so I can imagine you can get a good pub meal should you decide to. I ate out all the time, as I was meeting friends, but next time I might just give it a try. Had two small bottles of water provided every day and a nice little selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks in the fridge, as well as a good coffee and tea supply. I really liked my room and felt very comfortable in it. As a matter of fact, I am thinking of booking again for October, as the location is just top-notch and so convenient for all the places I want to go to!",8.0,August 2021,"September 6, 2021",Single Room with Shower,5,Solo traveler,8

Good location for exploring.,"The noise. 
We were not informed during check in of a limited breakfast service on the day we left and arrived o minutes after 9am, breakfast finished at 9. The staff member spoke with was initially abrupt and quite angry, it seems there were a few of us not informed of this which put their morning plans back. I wanted to leave and get breakfast elsewhere as I felt like we had out the hotel out! However he offered to make us breakfast 'as long as we were quick' and later apologised for his manner. Which I appreciated.

A great place to stay.,"One woman was very curt when we first got there as we were early. She didn’t offer any help to store our luggage etc. she just held up three fingers to indicate we couldn’t check in till then and walked off! 
I also didn’t like the fact I couldn’t book a table on the Saturday as it was my 60th birthday and I wanted to be sure of a meal. ( no special help offered) Turns out it would’ve been too noisy and we booked somewhere else.  No big problem.","This hotel/pub is quirky and fun. 
Ours was a special birthday trip which coincided with Christmas. 
The bar was incredibly noisy at night with people enjoying themselves. It was a great atmosphere. 
The room was lovely, small but with everything you need. The trains rumbled by but it wasn’t intrusive and I liked the sound.  There are ear plugs if you need them but the double glazing was excellent. 
The mini bar had free beer, water and soft drinks. 
We ate in the bar on the first night. The food was good with plentiful portions. Breakfast was delicious with lots of choice. 
The stairs are quite narrow. I wouldn’t recommend to stay here if you have any mobility issues.

Wonderful,,"We received a very warm welcome from Chris who made us feel at home with a straightforward registration and his explanation of everything concerning our room and the access to the hotel itself after hours. He showed us to our room in person too. We found all the staff to be helpful and friendly. 

The attention and consideration to detail throughout our stay was awesome. This meant that the room was clean, comfortable and functional; the shower was really good with 3 pumps at hand of hair shampoo, conditioner and liquid body soap affixed to the shower wall;  the white towels were fluffy and abundant in size; the hairdryer was plugged by a mirror in the room itself; the beds were very comfortable; the heating was just right and easy to adjust; there were hot and cold drinks available, small snacks too...  

Our stay included breakfast which was a combination of buffet breakfast and hot served food to order, with a special menu for kids. I ordered a full English breakfast. David the Chef served generous portions and all the food was delicious 

We had breakfast at this hotel on Christmas Day itself too, before leaving to visit family outside London.  We were really touched to receive a Christmas card, a cracker and present (consisting of a box of chocolates) from all the staff. 

There was also an amazing selection of songs from the 80s, and wonderful Christmas songs being played on the screen to bring on the festive season...

"Enjoyed our stay, would probably stay again","The continental breakfast options were a bit lacking - just a plate of small croissants and two juices. The hot menu was fairly standard, but I didn't enjoy the scrambled egg - too peppery and had definitely been held on a hot plate.
The room wasn't as large as I would have expected for a 'luxury double' but it wasn't small either.
The shower room was small and serviceable. but the shower door didn't close properly so the shower leaked and the wood around it was water damaged, the light fitting in the shower was quite rusty.","The hotel was really easy to find.
The Pub downstairs was very friendly - hostess on the Saturday evening very welcoming, taking drinks order and bringing it over. Room high enough that noise from Pub was not an issue.
Wide range of hot drinks in room.

Brilliant stay,Only minor point I was disappointed in was the bacon on the breakfast. It was Smokey streaky bacon. Would prefer proper back bacon.,Hotel in a brilliant location. Waterloo tube straight over the road or just a short walk over the bridge to Covent Garden. Rooms small but absolutely adequate for what we needed. Bathroom great with a powerful shower. Bed was like sleeping on a cloud. We were at the front of the building which was noisy. I’m a deep sleeper so didn’t affect me but they did provide earplugs.

"Alright, wouldn’t stay again.","The rooms were shoddy, and run down and the bathroom had mould and cracked shower tiles and the water only ran warm. The decor was dated and there were marks all over the walls and furniture. 
The rooms were so hot that you had to choose between opening the window and dealing with noise or keeping it quiet and boiling throughout the night.

Hotel located inside the Pub near train station,"It will be the bartender lady. I wasn't sure where the reception was at, so I asked the lady who seems to be a bartender of the pub, she just simply pointed to nowhere and said ""there"". After back and forth, I realised she meant at the end of the bench... She wasn't serving anyone so I don't know where the attitude comes from, however after I had a conversation with the gentleman, I realised she was just a pub staff member, not one of the receptionists. Just by that attitude, if she was a hotel staff member, I can give a 1 star review with no second thought.","Full English Breakfast

It's primarily a pub with only 10 rooms, which I think is the unique feature of this place that I really enjoyed.

We were on the second floor and this didn’t bother us at all but people with mobility issues may need to contact the hotel before booking.,"Excellent location, just outside Waterloo station. Booked the twin room with Shower. Room was a good size. Beds were comfy. Had a desk and chair in the room with tea and coffee making facilities (the coffee was very good and were special coffee bags). The bathroom was a good size and the shower was powerful. The rooms were cleaned every day. We met the housekeeping girls and they were very friendly and did a good job. Breakfast was included in the price and it was incredible. There was a continental buffet and cooked breakfast made to order. The smashed avocado, tomatoes, and poached eggs on sourdough bread was incredible and I had almost every day. The eggs Benedict was fresh with gorgeous hollandaise sauce. Breakfast was busy with people yet we didn’t have to wait too long for food. The breakfast staff were lovely and caring and one of the managers/owners was very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. With the amount of people at breakfast and the fact the rooms are above a busy pub, I was expecting the hotel to be noisy but I didn’t hear anything. We had the window open and there was only minimal noise heard from outside. We had a morning flight to London and an evening flight home and there was no extra charge to store the bags before check in and after check out.

Downstairs the Wellington was a well established and popular public house, frequented by locals and tourists.

The menu was good value, we had a great meal and the service was warm, friendly and reasonably quick.

Breakfast in the morning was probably the best we have had, setting us up for a long day of sightseeing.

To top it all, the staff were all very helpful and obliging and made our stay very welcoming.

Would stay again in a heartbeat!,I can see that if you had an upper floor the stairs would be trickier to navigate with lots of luggage.,"the location was fabulous. being so close to a central station with buses, the Tube, and the train service was so handy. We could get to anywhere we wanted so easily. 

The rooms are typical for European standards, in that they are small for North Americans. however, there was cold water in the fridge, a window that opened for fresh air, and a fan left in our room for the hot days. 

The breakfast was superb. A nice little buffet with fresh fruit and croissants, but also a delicious menu to order from. The smoked salmon was a hit, as was the avocado toast. The staff was so helpful and accommodating.",10,July 2023,"July 6, 2023",Luxury Double Room,3,Family,8

Each morning we had a full English breakfast which was excellent. Highly recommend this place for location and value for money. Room was clean it was a bit warm and a fan was in the room but knew that their was no aircon before we booked .

"Location is premium, but other factors makes this a no in future","the noise from outside is loud as my room looked out directly onto the main waterloo road.
You could not keep the windows open for air flow due to the noise of the bar people downstairs. With no lift in the
hotel and being 59 climbing 3 flights of stairs was a bit heavy.

"Great location, but we barely got any sleep","Even though the hotel has a lot of good or even great features, I still wouldn't recommend it to be honest. This has three main reasons. 

Firstly, the hotel is located right next to the train tracks, and the trains cause a lot of noise. The hotel gives you earplugs and the room has double windows (not just double glass, but actually double windows), so they really can't be blamed for it. However, it still caused us to have very little sleep, unfortunately. The trains only stop running from 2 to 6 am approximately. The earplugs help a bit, but the noise is so loud that it's still very hard to sleep through it, even with earplugs.

Secondly, it was increadibly hot in our room. The hotel doesn't have airconditioning, and the windows can only be opened a tiny bit. There's a fan in the room which only helps a little bit, but not barely enough. The outside temperature was around 28 degrees celsius during the day and 18 during the night in the weekend that we were there (so no extreme temperatures), but inside the room it felt like a constant 35 degrees. We asked for a second fan, but apparently there was none available. This hotel really needs an airconditioning, or they should at least enable you to open the windows completely. Of course it very much depends on the time of the year in which you visit, and the floor you're staying at (we were on the top floor).

Finally, the pillows were terrible. I've traveled quite a lot, but I can't remember ever having to sleep on pillows like this. The bed itself was a bit hard as well, but it was still ok. 

To sum up; even though it's a nice hotel on a great location, I wouldn't recommend it because we barely got any sleep last weekend. This was mainly caused by the noise and the heat.","The location was great! It's only a 10 minute walk to the London eye or to Westminster. It's in the hart of Waterloo and right across the Waterloo station.

The staff is great too, they were friendly and helpfull. 

Also, the room is quite big for London standards, and the pub below the hotel is a really nice place to hang out. 

Finally, the breakfast and dinner were really good as well.",5.0,June 2023,"June 26, 2023",Luxury Double Room,3,Couple,8

But if that's the only negative, then the place is onto a winner to me.

I'd 100% go back!!","The location was absolutely fantastic. It was straight across the way from Waterloo tube station. So, it made access to everything super easy.
I was a little concerned that it may be a bit noisy, but it really wasn't. There are soundproofing sliding windows fitted, which were great. They completely shut out all the hustle and bustle outside. 
We were a few floors up, so you also couldn't hear any noise from the pub downstairs either.

The location is amazing—extremely close to many attractions and conveniently located right next to a bus stop.

A great base in central London for any and all activities!,"The only thing that I didn't like is that there was no air conditioning available, but this is nothing to hold against the hotel in truth since it's uncommon in the UK. Do note that you should be comfortable with the sound of the train at night if sleeping with the windows open. That was perfect white noise for me, but it's not for everyone.","The comfort and size of the room, great central location, and fantastic staff were the highlights of my stay.

Wellington Hotel fabulous Place to Stay,NOTHING AT ALL,"From the moment you step in the door to the Hotel/Pub you are treated like Royalty, dealt with straight away, even though the Pub was busy,
Nothing is too much trouble 
Rooms were well equipped and had 2 fans, one either side of the Twin Beds. Perfect due to the warm weather.
Breakfast was the best we have ever had,  and we have stayed at many a Hotel around the World.
Staff from the bar staff, waiting staff, cleaners we absolutely lovely, It was like staying with family and friends.

Due to the Rail Strikes My Son and I were stranded in London over night, the staff at the hotel (ELLESE) went out of her way to try and find us a room in another hotel to stay the night, as the wellington was full.
Another member of staff (VALENA) also went over and above to deal with us, allowing us to leave our bags in storage.

I would not hesitate to recommend anyone to stay here.
I will be back with my family again 100 Percent

Pleasant,"In 2 days before arrival to the hotel we've got a letter with the following infirmation:
Chech-In from 2.00 pm to 11.00 pm. 
Also we were offered to make an online check-in in order to save our time. 
When we came at 2 pm there was no one at the check-in point. At 2-15 there finally appeared dark-skinned girl named Fa or something like that. When we approached and asked her if we can collect our keys she answered us in a very rude maneer to take our place and wait because there were other customers (who were queueing behind us, btw), and we should be happy that she was doing us a favour by checking us in at that time, as it turned out that the check-in time was 3 pm (thought we were notified it was 2pm)!
She completely ruined the first impression from the place. I work in customer service as well and I was shocked by the way she let herself speak with us. I would be fired straight away for beeing that rude to a customer.","Breakfast was perfect, complimentary mini-bar, pub on the first floor, location.

The Wellington is a very convenient stay and a good value that offers a very personable experience.,"Some things that you may not like.  The building is the real thing, so it's old.  There is no elevator and the stars are steep and twisty.  I had one heavy bag and a room at the very top so getting there required some work.  The staff will assist you, but expect to put in effort into your move in.  It's typical older European, there is no AC.  Also, the rooms really are stacked over a working pub across the street from one of London's major train stations, there is a lot of activity that goes on, some nights well past midnight, and you will be aware of it.  I loved every minute of it, If you're looking for a more sterile big chain hotel experience the Wellington may not be for you.","Pretty much everything.  Wellington is a three story hotel in an old building, integrated above a large and busy pub, across the street from Waterloo Station.  It's a bit unique, hotel check in is one end of the bar.  The room was very nice.  It was a little bit bigger than I'd expected and very clean, with fast WIFI.  I was on the top floor, which was high enough to catch a breeze and be comfortable on an unusually hot London day.  The bed was typical European but very comfortable.  The Wellington pub is big and has a great selection.  After checking out of Wellington I came back the evening of the Women's World Cup and had one of the best steak pies I've ever had in the pub.  I can't say enough good about the staff, walk in the door and they're little rough and tough (hey, it's a brit pub...).  Once they know you are staying with them they are genuinely warm and interested and open to you.",10,July 2022,"August 3, 2022",Luxury Double Room,1,Solo traveler,8
Good location and friendly staff but that’s pretty much the only positives.,"the bathroom door was broken and didn’t close properly, the room itself was like walking into an oven extremely hot so had a really poor nights sleep even the little desk fan didn’t help.

Room compact but exactly what we needed with good shower and comfy bed - also generous coffee and tea making facilities.  We returned from our event to a brilliant spontaneous party celebrating the Euro football win.  A fantastic atmosphere! We did not stay to the end but after a drink in the bar went to our room.

There is no room to move in the bedroom, you cannot walk around the bed without knocking your legs or feet, the photos are very deceptive, it is extremely claustrophobic! There was only one member of staff that acted like they wanted to be there, the rest seriously lacked communication and people skills which puts a dampener on an attractive pub. The bathroom floorboards in our bedroom were rotting away, with a hole in the ground around the shower which my partner twisted an ankle on as it is deceptive. No lift, so have to carry suitcases up several flights of narrow stairs. Absolute waste of money, extremely disappointed.","The location of the hotel could not have been better, across the road from Waterloo Station and within walking distance from main tourist sites.

 Breakfast - coffee pot was empty and there were no glasses for the orange juice. Not much food to choose from like a hotel would have, and as I said above I thought it was a hotel, not a pub. I have allergies but there was no gluten-free option Available. 

The sheet under the bedsheet had urine stains. The light fixture was loose. The tv aerial was hanging over the tv with bare copper wires showing and the signal kept cutting out. The sink had a shelf so close to it that I couldn’t spit my toothpaste into the sink without banging my head on the shelf. It was so close it was silly. 

However, my got there late at night and left first thing in the morning so for that reason, it was just a bed that was needed. so convenient.

I’m not sure I’d stay there again though as I’ve paid similar prices for actual hotels with better options in the past.",close to station and convenient,6.0,November 2021,"November 25, 2021",Double Room with Shower,1,Family,8

Pleasant,"We arrived about 20 minutes before it was time to check in. When the girl on reception eventually acknowledged we we there we were told we could leave our bags and go for a walk or get a drink and the girl would let us know when the room was ready. We chose to buy a drink and sat near the bar. We just sat talking and lost track of time but it was well over an hour later when we realised no one had come over. I went to the check in desk and there was no one there but I eventually found someone who showed us to our room. 

Be warned this is right next to a railway so the rumble and noise of trains is constant. That was a little expected. What was not expected was the very load music till 2am. I did suspect it might be noisy when free earplugs were placed on the bedside table for our use. This was on a Thursday night. Not sure if load music till the early hours is the norm.","The room itself was adequate. It was clean and a decent size. The bed was comfortable and it had clean comfortable bedding. The ensuite was clean and a good size. The hotel is south of the river across Waterloo Bridge just a 20 - 30 minute walk from theatre land so the location is good.

Good location but be prepared for outside noise,"Very poorly fitting window in bathroom, meaning very little protection from street noise. Needs urgent attention as currently taped up all along the edges to plug gaps (?) -  to little avail. 

Insufficient soundproofing on bedroom windows so the noise from the street outside and the pub customers was really loud. Earplugs were provided and thankfully I also had my noise cancelling headphones which I had to sleep with for part of the night. I was prepared for the noise of trains, but actually I couldn’t even hear the noise of the trains over the noise of the street and pub. 

Sadly, despite the perfect location I won’t be booking there again until the windows/soundproofing is improved as the possibility to be able to sleep should be a minimum requirement for any hotel room.","I loved the location close to where I was working.

Definitely book again,"We were on the top floor and should have requested lower level on booking as lots of stairs, need to have good mobility as no lift to get to the top, had hand rails and space on landings to stop and catch your breath inbetween.","Room was great.

Dirty,"Overall bad experience. Booked this hotel mainly because of convenient location for a celebration on that day. We were also aware that this is rather a budget hotel, but as we had a party nearby we didn't plan to spend too much time in the hotel + the rating at booking.com is good. To start with, real rooms dont look like ones on the photo, they are much darker and smaller (we didnt book the luxury room though, maybe they are nicer). We were allocated room 20 in the hotel, its very small, a bit dark and faces the tracks. Which was ok nevertheless. We unpacked and left to the event. 
When we came back late in the evening and prepared for sleep, I have noticed several gray stains on the top sheet under the blanket. Went to the reception and (really nice) staff came up with me to change the sheets. Apparently there were bloody stains right underneath the top sheet! Pictures are attached. We had to repack and change the rooms. The second room (room 15) was nicer, more spacious and brighter. No visible stains; except of rather dirty windows and curtains, the room looked ok. But obviously after experience at the previous room, had no chance to relax and we slept in full clothes. 
+ next morning at breakfast (which very positively surprised us after the previous evening) - one of the ""cleaned"" glasses that we took from the bar had traces of someone's lips.... 
I really hope we were just very unlucky and these things were unintentionally missed, as reviewers on similar dates as our visit seem to have a much better experience...",Really delicious breakfast with plenty of options and friendly staff.

No airflow at all. It was literally over 90°F in the room. We were given 3 fans but that only blows hot air right? Something must be done, perhaps window air unit for just that room? So much noise from Waterloo Station, the inebriated, and traffic all night was another problem, exacerbated by needing the window open for any air.

"good breakfast, extremely noisy surroundings","It was extremely noisy when I arrived as downstairs there's a large pub, crowded with people celebrating their weekend.
On top of that, my room was literally less than 1 meter from an iron railway bridge, many trains passed both during the evening and part of the night, starting again earlt in the morning. This comes on top of ordinary traffic on a main road (but that's sort of to be expected near Waterloo Station)

Room was tinny, so not sure how someone with large suitcases would have fit them in. Also, no elevators and super narrow stairs. Again not suited for people with large suitcases or mobility issues. I would’ve received more attention from a self check-in machine. The only person who said hello and was kind was the cleaning lady when she saw were were leaving our room.  Everyone else was rude with no manners.  The location was terrible, dirty, dingy, drunks and homeless everywhere approaching you. Next to a train station so constant noise. They do provide ear plugs. Restaurant kitchen closed at 8:00 pm. I would not recommend this hotel even though it was economical.

Pleasant,"The location again! It's on top of a very busy pub and the first time you go in has to be through the pub. I didn't quite feel safe.

Very Poor,"As mentioned above, the noise by railway and cleanliness of the hotel's are big issues.

Cheap and good location,"The hotel is exactly what the description states, although one thing that was really annoying was baggage storage, if the hotel has 25 rooms then they should invest in storage space for the bags that are going to be left on checkout and check in days. As the tiny luggage storage compartment was full they ended up stuffing them behind the bar which was not ideal at all, we didn’t feel confident leaving our backpack with the iPad in so we ended up taking it all round London with us. We also ended up paying to leave our bag in Euston station £15 for 24hrs) on our last day as again all the bags from other guests were just being places behind the bar again.
In addition to this it was rubbish coffee in the morning, filter watered down tasteless coffee, it doesn’t take a lot to have a bean to cup standard coffee machine for guests. However there is a great coffee cart parked up right outside the hotel, nice friendly guy too.","The location of the hotel was fantastic, opposite the underground was great.
