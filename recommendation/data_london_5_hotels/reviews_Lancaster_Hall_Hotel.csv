Dated bathroom dampens a pleasant overall experience,"Dated bathroom. Mould around edge of bath. Not a fan of hotels that place towel rails above the toilet. Tiny, old kettle in room that me and my partner didn't want to use. Tired carpet. Until new bathrooms are fitted, the hotel feels considerably overpriced.","The bedroom was comfortable and clean.

"Excellent stay, perfect location, great breakfast.","Insufficient ventilation in the room. As the rooms don't have aircon, the room was quite stuffy, even on a mild summers day in June. The windows only open a tiny bit for safety reasons, and heavy drapes impede any airflow you might get. There was a small desk-top fan available but there wasn't really a desk to position it.  At the very least a floor fan would help a bit better.","Excellent stay, very good location. Lovely helpfull staff, helping us to store our luggage when we arrived long before our room was going to be ready. Great (continental, not english) breakfast. Comfortable quiet room, we were on the third floor looking over the back yard and it was very quiet. Spacious bathroom with a good shower over bath.

Wonderful hotel for a 2 night stay!,,"Wonderful hotel for a 2 night stay! Had all the necessities. Room was clean and tidy, bathrooms were in good working condition, rooms had good AC and the TV had lots of stations. We were able to drop off our bags before Check-in and front desk was very nice and welcoming. We received 2 free bottles of water in our room upon arrival and there was a little tea set for nights. Breakfast was mid- nothing spectacular (boiled eggs, bread, pastries, croissants, tea). The bag drop area was a bit outdated but the room section of the hotel was more modern.

It was very close to bus and train stations- 5/8 min walk tops and close to restaurants, supermarket and such in the Paddington area. Very safe area and close to the city Centre- we got to most of the main attractions within 20 min or so by public transit (with traffic).

Very pleasant stay!,"Bathroom sink has two separate faucets,one for warm and other for cold watter,which is very inconvenient. A bit more spacious rooms would also be appreciated. We appreciated continental European electrical socket,but since we both had to charge our phones during the night, 2 sockets for a two person room would be best. (We also had EU/UK socket adapter,but our phones didn't charge on neither of the 2 UK sockets.Perhaps our adapter was faulty, cannot be sure).","Very good location,couple of minutes walk from Lancaster Gate and Paddington stations.Quiet part of the street,very friendly staff and good breakfast.Room was clean and we appreciated new windows.",9.0,April 2024,"May 28, 2024",Standard Twin Room,3,Group,8

"Great hotel, room, staff and location","Unfortunately i requested a quiet room away from any stairs and lift at the end of a corridor on the highest floor possible but were given a room on first floor nearest to lift, we did get a move to the 2nd floor but again room nearest to lift so could hear everyone coming and going, so this let the whole experience down with very little sleep as the room inside and staff were great.
Note: NOT THE HOTELS FAULT but we also had a loud group of idiots going back and forth rooms, talking in the corridor, food being delivered and a couple in the group arguing throwing things around their room from 2.30am until around 6am, they were speaking in French, i did go and confront them (also another room confronted them) and were quiet for all of 10 mins before starting again. I approached the reception and told them of the problem we had had and they did apologies but we did not get offered a later check out when i asked about check out.  With such an early check out of 10.30am and no real good sleep our Sunday last day in London was left tired and unenjoyable. 
We were going to book here again for 2 weeks later but due to the bad sleep experience we have booked in to a different hotel.","The room had all you needed for a comfortable stay and was very clean, staff really polite, great location and the reception snack bar is a nice touch.

Modern comfortable hotel just north of Hyde Park,"Every morning the elevator seemed to be used by some linen service moving bags labeled ""work wear"" from a semi truck parked on the street into the lobby 
elevator and then down to the laundry room in the basement 😳 I am not sure what was going on but the result was that it tied up both 
elevators when they were loading and unloading and made it difficult for guests to use the elevator to breakfast. It was a bit bizarre!","The staff were all very helpful and friendly. We were very pleased that we were able to check into the hotel early and get a parking place in
the hotel garage. The location of the hotel is excellent, just outside the Congestion zone, near bus, tube stations and Hyde Park! 
There are many choices of restaurants nearby. The lobby and breakfast room are spacious and modern.
The room, though not large was comfortable. I liked that our room had two large windows which could be tilted and had a view over rooftops.

Ill suggest making a smart key (similar to the room key) which guests could use to open the hotel door themselfs without having to wait for the one staff member that is there at night, to prevent hotel guests from waiting in the British cold and rain after a long day of traveling.

Thin walls and a very old shower at a great location,"The room was very old, which meant it didn't feel clean.

The sink was so old that the hot and cold water are separated so you can't water at one ""normal"" temperature. The walls are probably super thin as we could hear a baby in the next room crying ALL NIGHT (I'm not blaming the parents, the walls should be better soundproofed).

"""Vintage"" hotel - conveniently close to Paddington station and public transport.","I guess it was an honest mistake but, when I arrived they wanted me to pay at arrival - which wouldn't be that much of a problem, all hotels require a certain deposit. BUT, they didn't check I'd already paid in advance via Booking.com, which made the whole situation fishy, as I had to reach for my phone to show I already paid - and only THEN they checked and confirmed... I've been scammed before once so I'm always kinda alert about things like this. Make sure you have your hotel e-mail confirmation with you at check-in every time you travel! 
The room was not as pictured, ofc they show pictures of the front facing rooms of the hotel with nice view on the church in front, but the back facing rooms have, well, not a nice view. The walls were dirty, the tub was moldy, you could hardly change the temperature on the shower - which burnt my skin off. The doors were super loud, and I get it you can't soundproof every room, but when people simply close the doors and it comes with a loud BANG (especially at night) it makes your stay there very uncomfortable. There were 2 separate beds in the room I chose the one on the first night which wasn't next to a wall. Bad idea, the mattress kept slipping off the bed at every turn, super narrow and soft. Good thing I could sleep on the other bed from the following night. :'D","The Hotel was super close to Paddington station which is really convenient when your flight is from Heathtrow. They had EU standard plugs besides the British version which was useful for plugging one device into that and use my british/EU adapter on the other. After every houskeeping, new biscuits and teabags placed on table which was a nice touch. Staff was nice.",5.0,March 2023,"March 30, 2023",Standard Twin Room,4,Solo traveler,8

"Disappointed, though there were some great features to this hotel.","Putting customers in a room street-side on a Friday night was poor judgment. I couldn’t sleep until 4:30 am because of people screaming, laughing, yelling, throwing things. Some noise on a weekend night is to be expected. This was excruciating and excessive. I’ve stayed all over the world and never had an experience like that before. I believe the unruly behavior came from kids who were staying at the hostel which is operated by the hotel. I called the front desk at 3 am and the staff member (a man) said he couldn’t do anything about the situation. The staff the next morning (two young women) were defensive and took no responsibility for what happened and showed no sympathy. Only when I quietly but firmly and persistently asked them to put me in a different room for the next evening did they respond—reluctantly. Staff shouldn’t be afraid of criticism. They should solve the problem and not make the customer feel guilty for identifying the problem.",One staff member (a tall gentleman) was very friendly and helpful in answering questions about transportation to the airport and about where to go for a COVID test (required for travel).,5.0,May 2022,"May 9, 2022",Standard Twin Room,2,Solo traveler,8
