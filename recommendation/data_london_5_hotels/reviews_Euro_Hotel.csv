The locks are all very secure! Shower was big and spacious, although the shower head was old, and the extractor wasn't working. Fixtures and fittings are all generally quite old, but for one night plus breakfast I can't complain! Kept the tall balcony windows opened at night so I was never 'too warm', like some other people have commented being.

My husband did ask for the quantity he wanted for each item which I laughed at but wish we had done the same as he got a reasonable breakfast but we didn't. 

Some of the staff were really friendly but some weren't. It felt like you were being a bit of an imposition.

Lovely clean hotel in a quiet location with very friendly hosts.,A few minor points to make.  At breakfast time there would occasionally be one person sat at a four person table so if extra people came down to breakfast they had to wait for the table to become free.  It would be better to match the number of guests in a room to the size of the table and guests have that table for the entirety of their stay.  This would stop delays for people having to queue for a table.  One other minor point is that the hot breakfast was brought out a little too early as we were still eating our cereals when the hot breakfast arrived.,"Very friendly hosts.  Check in and out was very efficient.  Lovely and plentiful breakfast.  Room clean and spacious, warm and comfy bed.  Appreciated the free wifi.

OK for a short stay,The very small shower cubicle. The hose to the shower head leaked water badly affecting the water pressure (took a long time for hot water to come through too).

My partner ordered poached eggs - received one egg only. He asked for another and it served hard boiled. Serving sizes of other offerings are unusually small too. Filtered coffee was far too strong (there was no additional hot water to weaken it).,"Proximity to local shops, pubs and restaurants. Really close to St Pancras International. Beautiful tree lined crescent shaped street of old Georgian houses that are now all hotels. Fabulous if you get a street facing room to overlook the tennis courts.

"Enjoyed our stay, it was a good location for us, nice clean hotel.","Not an issue really, there was 3 of us but only 2 bottles of water, 2 cups & toiletries. 
A lot of Scaffolding being erected next door only a couple of metres from our room windows, (room 19) we were out all day so didn't disturb us but it does look like building work is due to start soon.
Shower room/toilet was fine, clean but no sink in there it was in the bedroom. Its the smallest shower cubical we have ever used, not that easy to use.
We enjoyed our stay my only real moan would be at breakfast. Ordered 2 full English breakfasts, our toast arrived and my husbands breakfast arrived, he ate it (slowly) and mine still hadn't arrived. two other tables were served theirs, so i asked about mine, it arrived a few minutes later apparently it was because i asked for a poached egg? my poached egg took 20 minutes longer than my husband breakfast with a fried egg? As we had a train to catch it was just a bit inconvenient and instead of just apologising for the wait or forgetting the lady just put it down and said its because poached eggs take longer to cook.","We enjoyed our stay and a good location for where we needed to be. Lovely quiet street and very pretty frontage. Easy check in the lady was very polite and helpful, characterful public areas nice and bright, Room was nice and clean, beds were quite comfortable. 2 fans in our room which was good. 2 bottles of water, tea & coffee facilities and toiletries provided.

The rating I gave was based on 53 with separate toilet and shower. I understand prices reflect things like bank holidays and carnivals etc but to treble the price for the same room is extortionate. I know that all hotels do this so this rant isnt aimed solely at the euro hotel. I have stayed at other hotels on this crescent and the euro is one of the best here.

No smells but very unsightly, it would have been thoughtful to at least let us know about it before hand. 

The breakfast was well laid out with the items on offer but if you are having cereal make sure you tell the staff to not bring the hot food out while you're still eating, this was most frustrating. When l asked the staff to take it back they looked at me in a not very pleasing way.

The bathroom was very small for a family room.","Being able to check in 40 minutes early as we arrived earlier than expected. Very friendly reception. Overlooking tennis courts to the front even though we were on the lower ground floor and couldn't see them. Considering it's only 10 minutes from Euston Station it is a very quiet location. Good size room for 2 adults and 2 teenage children. Even though on lower ground floor to the front, there was plenty of natural daylight. Big box sash opening window.

Comfortable stay,NONE!,"Location for 3 reasons: (1) the proximity to the Eurostar-King's Cross stations and to Russell Square station (tube) (2) the quiet-safe neighborhood (such a nice break from the hustle-bustle of the city center), just in front of a pleasant public garden (3) the proximity to the city center by directly Piccadilly Line. The neighborhood has a good mix: people from the neighborhood, offices, and the university, which gives travelers a glimpse of London's daily life. This is a small hotel with THE efficiency of the staffs. Impressive work, especially during the busy breakfast time. Bravo! Everything was great: the cleanness of the room, bathroom, and hotel AND the staffs' resourcefulness. The high ceiling room was a bonus, which did not give us a crammed feeling at all, in spite of the room size (not obvious from the Booking photos). A high ceiling room usually gives you a spacious effect; it is an intangible aspect, but surely it made a difference. What a pleasure to come back to a spacious room after spending all day walking. On our way to the tube station (Russel SQ) from the hotel, there are small cafes, restaurants, pubs, and mini grocery stores; there are ""Pret a Manger"" and TESCO (24h open) just in front of the tube station.

One was not (defensive and insistent that we paid after agreeing we cold pay the next morning once all was sorted out). When I did finally get into the room (at 23h30 as we had been to dinner) I discovered that the toilet roll holder was hanging off the wall, the plug in the sink didn't work properly, the toilet didn't flush well and the hand towel was marked.

Don't Book Here During Hot Weather in London,"So many things not to like about this hotel. For one, it was extremely overpriced. Second, the carpet in our room smelled really badly--maybe a cleaning solution? The bathroom had no towel racks or fan so if you showered during hot weather the room heated up really badly. It also advertises itself as a traditional Georgian building--great if you want all the worst features such as old carpet and tall windows that don't let in much air. It all felt like the owners just did  the bare minimum to keep the hotel running, but certainly nothing to warrant the high prices. Mostly I was disappointed with the staff. They were not very friendly when we checked in. We were there during a heat wave and when I mentioned that our fan didn't work properly, the staff person said they didn't have any more and that they were fully booked. It was night so I asked if they could get another one the following day and the staff person said no. So basically we were supposed to sleep the second night in  a room for which we paid almost 250 dollars/ night with a broken fan? The next day I asked again, and only after some badgering on my part did the staff procure me another fan. But really? Is a crappy review worth the 20 quid another fan would have cost the hotel to buy? So, all I can say is if you're coming to London during hot weather you might not want to stay here--the ventilation was non-existent and if your fan is broken and the hotel is full..tough luck? (And lest anyone think I'm a spoiled traveler, it was over 90 degrees during the day and the room was sauna-like at night, which is really unhealthy for older adults whose bodies cannot cool down at the same rate as younger people).",Hotel is in a good location.

Horrendous Experience,"When we arrived in our room, the window above the bed was wide open and there was water all over the headboard. It was completely soaked. My friend has a respiratory condition, so we considered that it genuinely was not safe for her to be staying in the room. When we discussed this with reception they offered us a refund, confirmed at the time by the manager.

Bed bugs and lack of integrity to issue full refund as promised,There were bed bugs! Then when I woke at 4:30 am and found them crawling on me I called reception and they came to my room and I showed them the bugs and I took photos and videos and they said they would give me a full refund which never happened and I had to find a new safe clean place to stay and pay for laundry service since there was bed bugs in their hotel and then today I get an email saying they are charging me for a night when they told me they were giving me a full refund. To top it off they booked a taxi for me to get to the new hotel I booked and the driver was a creep so I had to get let out close by like three blocks away and found a hotel and ran inside for help and the men there helped me to go address the driver and get my bag where I was asking me for 45 pounds to drive me three blocks! He didn’t have proper ID or a payment machine and was trying to get my credit card info to give a strange man on the telephone so I went to an atm with the security from the hotel I ran into for help with me the whole time and gave the corrupt driver 20 pounds for a 3 block drive then complained to the euro hotel for sending a woman alone with a unsafe unregistered cab and I took his licence place number in a photo and then the hotel took no responsibility at all for the safety of their guest and sent an email saying that I apparently didn’t use the taxi which is not the case at all and the whole experience was a night mare and now they want to charge me for a night when I already did the transaction for refund and have the documents and an email stating that they refunded me saying to wait since it was the weekend and then today get an email saying they are charging me for one night after all this mess and having to spend money on two hotels and treated so badly and them not taking responsibility and honoring my full refund is not ethical and they clearly do not care about their guests at all,Nothing,1.0,October 2022,"October 17, 2022",Standard Single Room with External Bathroom Facilities,1,Solo traveler,8
