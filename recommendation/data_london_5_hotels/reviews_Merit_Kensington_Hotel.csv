Amazing Location!,"The extra bed in our room was location just above the AC vent which mean that I was getting the air directly on my face and given its summer, turning it off was not an option. I did ask for an extra blanket/duvet but never got it.",The location is absolutely winner. Being walking distance to Earls Court station and also a variety of shops and restaurant makes it so convenient. The rooms were comfortable though a tad small but overall service was good. They were polite enough to allow us to change rooms given we didn't want to stay in the ground floor rooms.,8.0,August 2024,"August 23, 2024",Deluxe Double Room with Extra Bed,3,Group,8
The perfect base for central London.,"Tea and coffee could be refilled daily, but that's a very small constructive criticism.","A fabulous location, 2 mins walk from the Tube.

GO SOMEWHERE ELSE,Very poor front desk experience.  I checked in early and the woman seemed inept.  Then I showed up late in the afternoon and the staff seemed equally inept ...plus the first woman ate up a fair amount of my time because she couldn't figure out various things...so when the evening staff made me do some of this AGAIN it seemed a poor representation of the facility.  Ok hotel is well located - but the staff was so dumb TWICE that i wouldn't come again...many other places with equally good locations and prices.,,7.0,August 2024,"August 21, 2024",Double or Twin Room,1,Solo traveler,8

Good,The breakfast was cold on both mornings the staff in the breakfast room didn’t give you any information as to where the plates were or how to get tea and coffee .Our room was good but had an awful view of a brick wall when we arrived we were told our room was not ready but the American guests who checked in before us were told that there room was ready !,The proximity to Earl’s Court tube,7.0,August 2024,"August 16, 2024",Deluxe Double Room,2,Family,8

Wonderful,Nothing to complain about,"The zone where the hotel was located is very well positioned near everything. Also it's a safe and friendly zone.

The staff was very helpful and nice when needed help with anything.

The room was comfortable and very very clean. It was positioned at ground floor with a view on the main street which was a beautiful one. It also has a modern and easy to use ventilation system. Bathroom even if it was a small one it was very well take cared.

I would definitely stay here again next time when I'll come back in London!",9.0,August 2024,"August 13, 2024",Deluxe Single Room,3,Solo traveler,8

Wonderful modern hotel with a great location,"The doors to the buildings are not automatic and you have to manually open them.  In our building there was an outer and inner door very close together. I think this improves security, but it made entry and exit with large luggage difficult. However, it appeared that most of the nearby buildings and other hotels we experienced there also had manual doors. There were also several spots that contained multi-level steps in the hallway on the way to our room. Also a bit difficult to navigate large luggage, but there was an elevator in the building so it was not a major issue. All their buildings had entryway stairs with no ramps.  Someone with limited mobility may have more difficulty staying here, but for us the quality of the hotel and its amenities made this just a minor inconvenience.","The location of the hotel was very convenient and a short walk from the Earl's Court station.  We stayed in a double room in the 24 Penywern Rd building, which was right next to their main building where you check in.  I didn't realize it when I booked it, but the room had 2 double beds in a suite-type set-up, which worked out just fine. Rooms were very modern and updated with sensor lighting and controls. Although somewhat small (possibly due to the 2 double beds), there was plenty of room to relax, sleep, and stay.  The toiletry amenities and in-room coffee set up and fridge were a plus, especially since most hotels no longer offer such perks.  Room was clean and the linens and towels were great quality, and the bed was very comfortable.  We did not purchase the breakfast with our reservation, but we were able to purchase breakfast separately on arrival. The breakfast was worth it in my opinion, and had a good selection of hot and cold offerings.  Staff was very polite and helpful.  Would definitely stay here again on our next trip to London.",9.0,August 2024,"August 8, 2024",Double Room,2,Couple,8

Very pleasant stay,"I booked a Deluxe double room which was nice, only negative would be the bathroom is tiny but shower worked fine & nice big mirror etc . The view wasn’t great but to be honest we weren’t in the room for very long so didn’t bother me. Our fridge didn’t work but I only mentioned it when checking out as there was only water in there & didn’t want to make an issue of it but wanted to report it so that it could be sorted for next guests. Nothing put me off enough that I wouldn’t stay here again overall I liked this hotel & room & breakfast was nice","The hotel reception was very welcoming & friendly staff. Location was really good, just 5 minute walk from Earls Court underground. Plenty of shops, pubs & places to eat nearby.

"We were satisfied with the accommodation. A charming and clean room, hotel in a good location.","The window couldn't be opened (I assume due to the climate and ventilation system).

Good value stay in London.,"The hotel has several buildings near each other. In the center building is the reception and the breakfast room. My room was in an adjacent building. There are several steps in front of each building which makes it a little difficult with people who have difficulty with steps, but it was not a big deal.","The location was very convenient to public transport. I travelled on the Piccadilly line from Heathrow airport. At Earl's Court Station there is a lift from the platform level to the ground level (convenient with luggage).and the hotel is  a few minutes walk away. 
In addition to the Piccadilly line there is the District line and buses so it is easy to reach the center of London.
 I took the bus to Victoria train station which was even more convenient.
There are many restaurants, supermarkets, pubs and a pharmacy nearby.
The room was a Deluxe double room (for single use).
I requested a room on a high floor, near the elevator with a walk in shower and received exactly what I reserved. The size of the room was  a good size for London.
The room was modern, clean, with air-condition, had a safe and a small refrigerator that was very useful.

"Nicely decorated , clean rooms in Kensington Area","The Signage for the rooms could have been outside the elevator , although they did mention the floor , first floor means different things for American vs Brits :) just a suggestion .
we asked to be checked in and our bags moved to the rooms , this could have improved our overall experience , as we were 3 then one checked out and the rest moved to a smaller room. Not sure why it was an issue that check in had to be at 3 , if the system can be improved to allow guests to check in and at least know in which building they'll end up would be nice","Location was great next to earl's court subway station so convenient , on the picadilly line so you can go straight to the airport ,the rooms were very clean small but it was ok we booked 2 kind of rooms 
one was in the main building triple room and one was a twin bed room , both were nice and clean I would stay here again the location had many Halal eateries nearby which is a plus .
note that you can be in a separate building than the reception so I would suggest to check in before carrying your bags up the small stairs.
we arrived early and we had to store our bags in the reception area .
some of the staff were warm and welcoming and some were just courteous, I didnt expect friendliness so expectations were low already :D
honestly was expecting the worst when reading the reviews and I am someone who's critical , but it wasn't bad at all and it was too late for me to change my booking , I didn't regret staying here after all",9.0,May 2024,"May 29, 2024",Deluxe Double or Twin Room,2,Group,8

Excellent spotlessly clean hotel lovely staff. Brilliantly placed for tube access to go sight seeing,We were on the lower ground floor so didn’t have much of a view. But it was quiet. And we did have to go outside to walk a couple of doors down to go for breakfast. It looks like the company own a few houses side by side but there’s another hotel in the middle which I think stops them having inside access to the bit we were in.,We wanted to be near a tube station as we were going to Chelsea flower show Earl’s Court tube station is just round the corner a couple of minutes walk away.

Very good and worth your money,"The hair dryer is not easy to used like sometime its just turn off and you have to wait for a moment until it available again. Maybe they should change it.
And also because my room is on the ground floor close to the entrance and lift. I experienced the noises from the working lift and sometimes when people walking. Suggest for someone who’s sensitive in noise while sleeping avoid this room.
Also, i think maybe the hotel should have an extra security for ground floor rooms like outside people shouldn’t walk directly to our room and the hotel should add the door peephole.","The cleanliness of the room plus their change the towels and refill the amenities every day.

Worth considering but not if you can’t manage stairs.,"There were no Ramps for us to pull our suitcases up the stairs to reception. It was only stairs. There was a lift thankfully up to our rooms but it is tiny. The stairs up to our room are very narrow. One day we had been out all day and were very tired and when we finally got to our room it was being cleaned and we were told to come back in 20 mins which we then had to go and sit in the nearest pub and wait.
Also our air conditioning didn’t work in one of the rooms and then the other room was freezing.
Also the suite was very small and we had no where to store our 4 suitcases so we had to leave them standing up and when we wanted something from them we had to lay them down,get our stuff out and then stand them back up again.
Also the free water bottles didn’t get replenished at all.",It had a great location right on Earls court station and there were heaps of restaurants near by and souvenir shops. The area is very nice and felt safe walking around. The M&S food on the corner was very handy. The hotel was modern with key card entry and each of our rooms had windows to look out.

Little gem in Earls Court,"Man at reception, same one on all three occasions I had to go there. He was not a very good example of good customer service.   Did the bare minimum each time.

Point deducted from review for this. First impression given by staff really counts.

Perfect location and modern facilities,"Air con stopped working on the first night. I mentioned this to reception and was told it would be checked by housekeeping. Made 2 calls to reception the second night when London was in an unexpected heatwave... the air con was showing an error so was provided with a portable air conditioner. Asked at reception again after breakfast what the status was as I was told an electrician would need to check it. They offered me a different room so had to pack everything up before heading out and thankfully third night was very comfortable. Room was much bigger too.

I had a standard double room and found it a little small as a solo traveller so might be a bit cramped for couples. Sink was tiny too. But the upgraded room was perfect size wise. Wish I had booked that one originally.

Breakfast was ok. The pastries seemed stale and therefore not freshly baked that morning. Not many vegetarian/vegan options.","Amazing location. So easy to get around from the hotel.

I knew the room would be small, it indeed was. It was a pity that we were facing nothing by looking outside but a wall and actually could see into another room. We kept the curtains closed the whole time and were in the room only to sleep anyways. So for a short stay (we stayed two nights) that is okay but not for longer.

The reception could be better labeled on the awnings outside, for those who arrive on foot, on the sidewalk from the subway. Slightly confusing to myself and many other visitors I witnessed first walking to No. 12's door, which is labeled with the hotel name on the awning but isn't actually the reception. No. 16's awning is only labeled 16, but that's the hotel's reception.","The Deluxe Single Room was tiny, but big enough for my needs, as was the quite large single bed. The mattress was nice and firm without being too stiff, and the 4 pillows were not super tall.

The shower stall was the first one I've ever used in my 20 years of travels, where there was NO water on the bathroom floor after a shower. I wish all hotels used these stalls.

It is sadly accepted that you don't get too many square metres of floor space for your dollar in London but this was verging on the ridiculous. It took some very careful planning and coordination for two people to be vertical at the same time.
There was, a dressing table and chair but the close proximity of the bed prevented the use of the chair, rendering it to nothing more than an ornament. I think when you are paying in excess of £250 per night, it is not unreasonable to expect to be able to circumnavigate the room without the constant fear of breaking one's toes.","Visiting Wimbledon, so location was excellent.

Other than Marcelo (who was fantastic!), the rest of the staff was curt, unpleasant, and unhelpful. We joked that they had made it a competition to see who could answer questions using the fewest words.","The facilities were very new--in fact, I think some rooms were still under construction or had just been renovated. Nice high-end finishes and stylish touches. 

The highlight of our stay was Marcelo, who went out of his way to show kindness and made every effort to ensure our stay was comfortable. The hotel would do well to hire more staff members like him!

Location was unbeatable! Right around the corner from Earls Court station, which made it easy to get around London. Lots of nice restaurants, pubs, and cafes within easy walking distance--we could have spent a day just wandering the area near the hotel.",7.0,June 2023,"June 29, 2023",Double Room,2,Family,8

A great stay in London,"A few things could be improved. The dining room has a lot of lighting fixtures which are set too low and my husband hit his head on the first day when getting up from the table. We saw a few people banging their head when coming into the dining room. We reported this to the reception and I really hope that this will be fixed! 

The breakfast is OK but not great. The bread selection is very plain, mostly sliced bread. I would have liked more interesting and healthy bread. There is only salted butter which is weird for breakfast, doesn’t go with jam.  The fruit selection was poor. Still, it is a very good spread.","I was a little apprehensive about the hotel because not all the reviews were positive but I was very happy about the hotel altogether. The staff at the reception were very friendly. The hotel was totally renovated during the Covid pandemic and everything was done in good taste with very modern facilities. We booked a Deluxe room. True the room is small and if you got 2 large suitcases you have a problem. We had 2 trolleys so we were ok. The bed was very comfy. I liked the control panel near the bed controlling the lighting and the A/C. Everything worked perfectly. The bathroom was well equipped and also modern. Everything was very clean. The location is really very convenient so close to Earl’s Court underground, and a few stations away from theaters, museums and shopping.  The street is very nice and quiet.",8.0,June 2023,"June 27, 2023",Deluxe Double Room,5,Couple,8

London 4 Day Weekend,Our room was a bit too small to our liking. The space to walk from the bed into the bathrooms is not possible without basically sliding  over the edge of the bed and we're definitely not large people but would still say it's fine for a weekend getaway. Do not bring more than one large luggage for this room size cause you won't have much space to open them. A USB charger outlet next to the bed lamps would be nice to have especially for non-UK visitors just as a point for constructive criticism.,Late check-in was available and staff very friendly even at 1am. The hotel is very clean and well kept. The furniture looked fairly new. We were never bothered by room cleaning when the Do Not Disturb sign was active. The location is great if traveling by train/subway the District/Picadelly lines get you basically everywhere in the city. There's a decent sized fridge to store a large bottle water and snacks and there's a small convenience store just a few meters away walking towards the subway. The hotel is definitely great for a weekend getaway.,7.0,May 2023,"June 1, 2023",Deluxe Double Room,4,Couple,8
Excellent,We were on the basement level and at the front. Our window opened up into the area all the staff worked first thing in the morning with respect for cleaning and laundry.

Very Good,"Reception personal was not so attentive, to few questions regarding the directions or best way to get arround the city (during the Metro Strike) they were not so eager to get any good info or the info was just short and not informative. Also, our original booking didn't have breakfast and we booked it at reception....in 3 days we got 3 different prices from 3 different persons there, and only by mentioning that previous day was different price they would change with some excuse. Generally i would say that is not the best practice that I saw around. 

Also,room directions were not marked in building that we were located and first finding of our room looked like a small labyrinth game.",Room was small but clean and comfortable.

Hotel explained they do not get paid for the room until the guests check in/out which is why they needed to charge us an extra holding fee. Anyway it all worked out fine as the holding charge that was pending on the card was cancelled following checkout.

I would recommend this hotel as it boasts cheap prices but with a luxurious touch.,n/a,"Firstly, the layout of this hotel was odd, whereby the reception was separated from the rooms. The hotel and rooms can be found on the same street and are only separated by a few doors up or down from the reception. When entering the reception area, the first thing to notice was the area was very small and could be very crowded especially if multiple people are either booking in or booking out. 

The staff members were quiet and although not rude nor unprofessional, they did appear disinterested. Please also be aware this hotel asks for an further £100 to cover any issues and this amount will be refunded back to you after your stay. 

Myself and my partner had the deluxe double room booked for one night. The room itself was very clean and tidy. The room boasted tea, coffee and water for no extra charge. The bathroom was clean and modern with shower gel and shampoo to use freely. The room also consisted of other items such as a TV, blow dryer, mini fridge, safe, air conditioning etc. The lights for the room were controlled with an electrical pad which could be located in various places in the room such as next to the bed and the door. This was extremely handy, yet so simple! 

The hotel is located roughly 3 minutes away from the closest tube station and provides easy access to the central part of London.

"Good, but not great","The rooms were positively tiny. The bathroom was even tinier. The one shelf in the bathroom was already filled with complimentary items (which were nice), but left no room for our own toiletries. The mattress was a bit too hard for our liking. The rooms were equipped with a well working AC unit, but the placement of the unit was not well thought out. When enabled, it would blow icy cold air right in your face while you were in bed. Not great for one of our party, who is susceptible to ear infections. When disabled, the room would immediately start to become uncomfortably warm due to its small size. The window could be opened, but that helped little, and the window would fall shut on its own after a while as well. So we basically had a choice of either letting the AC make us sick, or sweating it out during the night.","The hotel was immaculately clean and the staff was very helpful.

"Good for the price, could be better with few small improvements","The room definitely needs some sort of mirror in it, whether full body or half body, somewhere where one can do their hair/makeup etc. When drying our hair, we had to use the tiny mirror behind the coffee station given you can't plug electricals in the bathroom. Pillows definitely need changing as they are flat and hard. The garden we had access to needs to be spruced up (painted, outdoor furniture etc) especially if it's part of the room and building utensils removed (ladder, excess bathroom tiles). Lastly, our cleaner took our used towels from the bathroom and folded them up and placed them on our bed which I found a bit odd.

A great place to stay for this solo traveller!,"I would have rated the property a 10/10, had it not been for the fact that no toilet paper was included in my daily room service on three separate occasions during my stay. On the one occasion that I rang down for some one morning, it never arrived by the time I left for the day (so I ended up collecting it from reception myself upon my return that evening). That said, every other aspect of the daily cleaning was superb, though. One other thing to keep in mind that might be a problem for some people - the noise from the street was quite noticeable, as was the noise from the hallways with other guests and cleaning staff along with the noise from others in the rooms/floors above using showers, basins and toilets at all times of the day/night.","I found the room to be excellent for me as a solo traveller. In fact, I felt the space was more than ample (and it felt bigger than what I expected based on photos and the blurb of the property online). This was great, as I stayed for a fortnight! The bed was super comfortable, the ability to control the brightness of the lights and the room temperature was fantastic, and the option of using a hand-held shower head or overhead rain shower was a nice touch. The room I was allocated was very modern, indicating that perhaps an update may have occurred in the recent past.

Cleanliness and furnishing unmatched with a few caveats.,"Our specific room had a couple of drawbacks:
1. Very minimal natural light, the window opened to what felt like we were in a basement. Bedroom lights were required to be on throughout the day, if you're out all day and stopping here to sleep then it is a non issue.
2. Our room was right next to a lift and very audible as well, this happened throughout the night and I think specific to our room. People traffic noise was frequent and would take place throughout the night which did disturb my sleep.
3. Rooms were pretty small for the price, but the trade off was a great location, not necessarily a downside but worth noting.","The furnishing and cleanliness is unmatched. Everything clean, bathroom free of any mould, kettle free of limescale.

The temperature was showing 19°c, but it felt much hotter and wouldn't go below this even on advice from reception. We had to call down twice for them to turn it down. This would have been alleviated if there had been a proper window, but as we were in the basement (no previous indication of this), we couldn't open it, as it opened by a wall and someone else's window and was very dirty.",We loved the cleanliness and comfort of the bed and bathroom.

Great value for the price,"While the rooms exterior was modernized and seemed to be recently renovated, the building was a bit old - I could hear the pipes, and unfortunately there was a smell from them as well (not too much, but I needed to open windows to let it go). The walls were not exactly withstanding the noise from the nearby room, but I believe this is due to the noise there exceeding usual levels (someone turned on TV to its max volume I think).
But this was def minor, hence I can't really say this will prevent me from booking in the hotel my next stay in London!","The room was just refurbished, and looked great! I totally expected it to be a 'cupboard' type of stay, just to spend the night, but the room was designed very well and had a lot of space considering its size. The location was superb - I could travel to every touristic part of the city without any problem and rarely used connections.
The room was clean, toiletries were good and quite a nice amount of them available for the use. Taking the price into account, I had also a small fridge and tea/coffee with a kettle, which was totally unexpected!

Staff was very friendly: I also was able to set a delivery to the reception for a few parcels, and it arrived very quickly and was hold till my visit with no problem. One day when the neighbor was rather loud, the receptionist tried to help to the best of her abilities - really appreciate the effort too.

Blood marvelous! (will definitely come back again&again!),"One thing I could fault though is the air conditioning. We went there during sunny days (17-18 degrees) & it was really warm. We had to ring reception to turn on the air condition (which is absolutely fine by the way) but I think it was timed. It turned off after a couple of hours & during the night, we woke up because the room was so hot.","There are a multiple of reasons why I love Merit Kensington:

1. 3 minutes away from Earl's Court Station - which means very accessible & near to all things London. Shops & good restaurants are just within the vicinity as well. 

2. Free room upgrade! - since I am on the Genius level they have upgraded my room for free which is a definite bonus.

3. Clean, new, & high tech rooms - they made sure that the room is tidy & clean. When we first came, the room smell like it is brand new. No traces of odor or stains seen all throughout. 

4. Comfortable bed & clean toilet/bathroom - as a regular traveler, what I always look for in a hotel/place is the bed and bathroom and both have 5-star rating in this hotel. The bed is super comfortable (I am a light sleeper, but man, did I sleep like a log!) & the bathroom is one of my favourites during this stay. 

5. Very helpful & polite staff - being situated in London, it is very rate to be greeted with friendly staff. The hotel staff are beyond helpful & so courteous.",9.0,March 2022,"March 26, 2022",Deluxe Double Room,3,Couple,8

"Overall it was pleasant but not luxurious, ideal for business trips but not necessarily leisure!","Due to some misunderstanding, my partner and I had been upgraded to the superior room out of courtesy for the hotels mistake. The room was made to look very special with rose petals on the bed a swan towels, very cute touch. 
However, the room size was very poor for a ‘superior room’, particularly the bathroom. The bathroom barely had enough room to move comfortably around in and I am of a small build and height.
The bed was very comfortable but it was two single beds pushed together which we were not impressed with. 
When we came back from our theatre night, we really wanted to get comfortable so we asked if the hotel could provide us with any robes or slippers of which they did not. We were told that hotel did not provide these amenities which we thought was rather disappointing given the cost of the stay. 
The hotel rooms were in VERY close capacity to eachother and things could be heard through the walls which isn’t really what you want during a peaceful trip away. 
It would appear that the hotel wanted to fit as many guests in as possible rather than making the hotel a better quality by designing bigger rooms.","The hotel is in a brilliant location, literally a minute walk to Earls Court station which runs the Piccadilly and Northen Line. Very convenient for travelling around London.
The reception area was very warm and inviting and had tasteful decor as did the rooms.
The majority of the staff were friendly and pleasant, one gentleman in particular who couldn’t have been more thorough and outgoing to assist us.

Excellent newish hotel with a few random things that need attention to make it even more perfect,"There are a few odd things that need attention.

For a 4 star hotel I would expect having water in the room. 
You can not adjust the temperature in the room. It is done via reception. It was freezing cold when I checked in and it took a while to heat up (after me calling to ask to put on the heating). You then have to call again for them to turn down the heating once the room is heated up.
No slippers- luckily I took my own. 
The bathroom is quite tight. I am a slim person, so it wasn't a big deal (you have to dry yourself in the room).
The third floor hallway has an incredible toxic air freshener smell- its too much. 

Once these things are sorted and I stay again, I will rate them 10!","Super clean, newish hotel. I got an upgrade and was very comfortable in my room. The lighting is nice and the bed super comfy.

The decor was very nice and modern (just like in the photos) and the touch screen panels by the bed were really great - you could control the air con and set various lighting levels easily. The curtains were surprisingly efficient at keeping out the morning sun. Fridge is a nice addition and we were provided with four tumblers and four wine glasses. The room is a perfectly good size for three average-sized girls, but might be a little tight if you were a larger person. 

The location is a real plus - just a minute or two from Earl's Court tube station which services the Picadilly line, Central line and District line. What's great about this is that you can take the tube from Heathrow right to Earl's Court. It's just a really handy tube station to be near. We got the tube every day.

The front desk staff were very friendly and allowed us to leave bags in the luggage room all day.

I wouldn't say this place is the absolute lap of luxury but it's excellent value for what it is in my opinion. I think the pictures accurately reflected our room. I will definitely be back though. Very positive experience.",9.0,August 2021,"September 5, 2021",Superior Quadruple Room,3,Group,8

Smart tv, high tech, underfloor heating in the bathroom. For the price you really can’t complain, I was surprised by just how much I got.

Unprofessional Staff Members,"I had a negative experience at the hotel. The young guy at the reception rushed my check-in, and the room only had enough towels for one person instead of two. Despite calling the reception for more towels, they were not delivered. The only helpful staff member was a guy from the night shift.

Furthermore, I left my Marshall speaker in the room, and when I contacted the hotel, they initially denied that I had left anything behind. After insisting and asking for an investigation, they suddenly found the speaker. I arranged for a friend to pick it up, and when she went to get it, the same young guy at the reception insisted that nothing was left there, and there was no record of the speaker. Eventually, someone else from the staff (a lady) found the speaker but did not apologize for the inconvenience.

These incidents have made me reconsider staying at this hotel in the future.","Very clean and modern rooms, 4-min walk from Earls Court tube station, in a quiet neighborhood with many amenities nearby.",7.0,June 2024,"June 16, 2024",Double Room,2,Group,8

"On the whole, it was a good night stay","Please, listen to my suggestions so than I will be more happy on my next stay. 
The main business telephone numbers provided both in the guest information book and on the website is always off or no one answer it.  You inform your guest in your guest book about numbers need to bee dialled from the bedroom if the guest required assistant. Also, your hotel employee  informed me about this as well. However, you have forgotten to install the landline phone in the bedroom while your main phone line is off except when is not when you don't answer it as I previously mentioned. Because I tried to call you from my mobile phone many times.  If it would be an emergency, you would fail to provide a safe place to stay. 
Its seems you must have done a great refurbishment but you need to finish it. 
The single bedroom is more likely a box room where no room to put down my luggage and open it. 
The shower cubicle with toilet is fairly okay but the mini wash basin is useless because its unsuitable for purpose.  Almost looks like a decoration not an actual bathroom wash basin. 
Could you please ask your cleaners to dust behind the TV screen because its seems hasn't been cleaned for a year. 
The heating system is not actually working properly. I think something wrong between the AC and Heater. I had to turn it off because my sinus is very sensitive and I didn't want to sleep wearing a hat in bed all night. I think sleeping cap is out of fashion this days. :-)

Good little gem of a hotel with walking distance of tube station!,The £100 pre authorisation(pending transaction) taken on arrival is a bit steep but common in London hotels and hopefully will not take more than 3-5 working days to be returned as standard. The room could also do with an iron and ironing board but no other suggestions.,"Thoroughly enjoyed my recent stay at the Merit Hotel. 

I came for a one night break for my mother’s birthday and arrival was upgraded to a family room which offered 3 beds ( two single and one double) instead of the twin i originally booked which was a nice touch. 

Room is compact but has everything required for a one night stay and laid out well. Area with Hangers, small Safe and empty mini Fridge was also handy to have to chill drinks. The outside and inside communal areas are clean and tidy and very modern like the rooms.

Great for a short city stay,"The area is kind of mixed. Not super nice but very convenient lots of attractions and places to go, very central. 
I booked a deluxe double room and it said on Booking.com that this was larger than average but it was in fact quite tiny. 
It was very compact with a small shower/toilet. The bed was a double fairly small for larger people. To be honest I can't remember how this was specified on the Web I should have been more attentive. It cost not much more than a basic but seriously, I am confused now as to how a basic could possibly be any different from a deluxe then.
Very new, very modern and super clean for a short city stay. The bathroom floor was gently heated even on summer days the warm tiles were lovely. 
The reception is two doors down from the Merit which was a bit unusual, there was no reception, no lobby seating, no Cafe or anything, or any visible staff at all in the hotel itself apart from the cleaners in the morning. 
There was a bit of noise from next door not sure if this was a fault in isolation or they were just super loud lots of thumping as if they were moving the furniture. Very strange!",See previous section,8.0,August 2021,"September 13, 2021",Deluxe Double Room,2,Couple,8

Exhausted.,"On Friday, 23rd August, we arrived at the hotel at 20:30 with two large suitcases. We were greeted by Nolix, and initially, everything seemed fine. We paid the £100 deposit, and he assigned us a room in the other building. Upon arriving at the other building, we discovered that the lift was not working. It's infuriating to know that Nolix was fully aware of this yet still chose to assign us a room on the third floor, Room 121. This is unacceptable.

We returned to the reception and questioned Nolix about the lift, as when you pay for a hotel stay, you expect all facilities to be functional and available. We are entitled to use all the amenities we paid for. He assured us that the lift company would come to inspect the lift, and we'd be informed of the outcome. He then offered us a smaller room as an alternative, which was entirely unsatisfactory. We paid for a specific room, and we should have been offered something of equal value of room 121, not something inferior even if it was an upgrade.

Adding insult to injury, when we asked Nolix if he could assist us with our luggage, given that we are two young women struggling with heavy bags, he outright refused. This lack of basic courtesy and assistance was appalling. We were left with no choice but to carry the heavy luggage ourselves. To our dismay, an elderly guest, probably in his 60s, offered to help us, but we couldn't in good conscience accept his help. I have documented medical issues with back pain, yet we had to haul the luggage ourselves up three flights of stairs.

On 24th August, we contacted reception again about the lift and were shocked to receive a completely different explanation. We had been led to believe that the lift would be fixed soon, so this inconsistency left us both disappointed and extremely dissatisfied. We were told to wait for the outcome, but it was clear at this point that we were being strung along.

On 25th August, we inquired once more about the lift.",Location.,4.0,August 2024,"August 28, 2024",Double Room,3,Group,8

Overall a nice hotel near the tube but overpriced for what you get. I’m glad I got a discount on it.,"Shoebox sized rooms, dents and marks on the walls, no assistance for large baggage getting up the stairs. A ramp would be nice. Neighbourhood attracts anti social types and homeless people.",Close to tube station and central London. Piccadilly line goes straight to Heathrow.,6.0,April 2024,"April 10, 2024",Double Room,1,Couple,8
Very nice hotel. Great location.,"The room was next to the lift. The lift noise didn't bother me so much as the guests who would chat by the lift at 1am or 3am in the morning. Unbelievable. Not the hotel's fault, but something I will make sure to avoid in future when I make a booking.

(Also, Booking.com should warn guests that a £100.00 deposit will be requested on arrival.  I understand some hotels do this, but it would be great to be told in advance).

Apart from this, I was very happy.","The room was immaculately clean and tidy. Nice bathroom with underfloor heating. A great shower. Had a very comfortable queen sized bed. The room also had a kettle and fridge which was fab. Would definitely recommend and be very happy to return to this hotel in the future. The location is excellent, very close to Earls Court tube.

Overall good hotel with great location,"The reception staff was a bit non-chalant towards us. We didn't even receive a ""Welcome"" or ""thank you for staying with us"" or even a explanation about the room or the breakfast. We had to ask for everything. Also we had to pay a deposit of £100, but there's nothing worth that much in the room. We also had to ask our deposit back otherwise i'm not sure it would've been voided.",The hotel is at a really great location. The tub is a 2 min walk and you can go to every touristic place. Also the rooms were small but not as bad as other reviews say (we had the deluxe). The bathroom was clean and a very very nice shower.

Regardless to him having to deal. With something difficult before us he should have then switched up! I really do hope the woman behind the desk who was watching was a manager and spoke to him after about how he dealt with us. Such a shame as the hotel as beautiful. It was quite noisy in the hotel room. You could hear the room next door talkim, going to the toilet, showering. If things like this doesn't bother you then the hotel is great!

Plug sockets stopped working in the room, so had to dry hair and iron in the corridor.

I bought a deluxe room and it was still very small. There wouldn’t have been any space for 2 people with suitcases. God knows what the normal room size is like.

No iron provided in room and when asked for one it was terribly and leaky.

Upkeep needs attention,"Maintenance needs to update routines. At first glance the room looks clean and modern, however in my room there was the smell of urine all throughout my stay. I tried to ignore it, but it was difficult to live like that. Then there's the sloppy maintenance. The bathtub drained slowly and was even blocked on the first night of my stay. The metal latch that connects the beds was missing a piece and thus it stuck out at an angle, something we had to be aware of as we walked around the bed as it could have cut our ankles. The Mirror and down light in the bathroom were damaged and hanging loosely... So all the small stuff adds up, I was just happy that I was only there a couple days. I just wanted a clean, well maintained room. The basic cleaners do a good job, but the upkeep is the issue here. Also, what's the deal with the fake grass out back? It's not even installed properly with spots of concrete not even covered. The price, the location and the short length of my stay were the only reasons I didn't move!

Amazing hotel / Abusive credit card charges,"My ratings are very different from my overall score, and here's why:

THE HOTEL CHARGED MY CARD TWICE, WITHOUT MY CONSENT, even if our stay was paid ahead of our arrival and an amount of 600 EUR (150/night) was blocked at check-in. The hotel blocked an additional 300+ EUR two nights before check-out, and another 300+ EUR the night before check-out, without letting us know about these charges either at check-in, during our stay, or at checkout. Meaning we had 1200+ EUR blocked on our card for over a month, even though we were promised that any charges should be released in matter of days. The additional 2x300+ Euros represented the parking, breakfast and bar charged to our room, WHICH WE ACTUALLY PAID AT CHECKOUT, instead of deducting it from the initial 600 Euros OR the additionally charged 300 Euros.

In all of our travels in over 40+ countries we never encountered such abusive approach when it comes handling credit card information! Moreover the whole experience made us feel like we were considered as thieves who would run off without paying!

I'm seriously considering reporting these actions to the consumer protection authorities, which I'm sure would not hesitate to do a review and issue a fine. Because what guarantees do we have now, that our card won't be charged again?!

Although it was one of the best hotels and stays, and we really did enjoy our time both at Merit Kensington AND in Hamburg, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this hotel.","+ amazing hotel in a great location by the lake, very close (5-10 minute walk) to the train station and city center, very close to street full of bakeries, bistros, restaurants

good location ; but too expensive for everything wrong with it,"the lack of help from staff with the bags. When i first checked in they put me in a room with a broken window seal, lots of flies and that smelled moldy. i wokeup with a cold the next day (im asthmatic so it was a disaster). they did agree to change the room for me given i was staying for a week but ended up giving me a smaller room than what i paid for. barely space to walk around.
when i asked for help to move my stuff, it was refused. Also, the phone in my room wasnt working so when i would call reception they couldnt hear me , but then no body came back to actually check what i needed. 
on my last day there i wokeup in the morning and there was NO HOT WATER. i had to shower in freezing cold water as i had a plane to catch. 
They took all my reusable fabric bags - including two expensive ones i had brought with me from home. they claimed they were thrown out because they thought it was trash and never even apologised for it. i personally think they were stolen because on my last day there i saw one of the cleaners using a similar fabric reusable carry on from Harrods for her cleaning products. in a country discouraging plastic bag usage i dont understand how they think fabric bags are trash.",i think the location was great! the cleaning of the room was good  and the bed was quite comfortable. i also liked that the station was less than 5 min walk and there were tons of food options and super markets.,5.0,June 2023,"July 26, 2023",Double Room,7,Solo traveler,8

A staff helped book taxi service on the xmas day. we already double confirmed with another staff if the booking was done. but ar the end, we were left unpicked up and had to look for another taxi back hotel.
 
The most upsetting incident to us is their rigid housekeeping rule. the housekeepers left us a note saying they are 4 star hotel so insisted to tidy up my bed when we were out, even though we have already clearly instructed them  beforehand not to tidy up the bed due to hygiene reason. we 1) told the receptionist but not happening, then 2) laid written notice on top of my bed and 3) pressed not-to-disturbed button.  Still, they did it 😤.  instead of explaining to me their reason of their insistent, they left a written note next to me note (2 above) claiming they need to clean my bed due to policy.  they must understand, if they were a high end hotel, instead of insisting of finishing their regular routine housekeeping tasks, satisfying customers’ want is more important. 
also, entering the room when the non disturb button is ON, must be refrained.","Most hardware is modern and new; I like the mattress which is not too soft, shower water is hot and strong enough; location is excellent.",6.0,December 2022,"December 30, 2022",Suite with Garden View,12,Family,8

One of the rooms got a free upgrade, and by comparison, the Superior room is truly spacious, especially for London. Was it a 10? Maybe not (simply because of the size of the deluxe) but it's worth compensating for some of the - I'd argue - unjustified negative reviews I've seen.

Good Staff but a disappointing hotel,"-Overpriced room (nearly £200 for a single night). 
-The room is really tiny and overcrowded. It’s ok for a solo guest but would be suffocating for a couple or a small family. The bathroom is stuffed as well. 
-The breakfast didn’t have variety even for a continental choice. 
-I got a room which looks over one of the rooftops of the floor below, so a horrible view and depressing. But I was staying for the night only so I passed it as the staff informed me it was the last room on the property. In my opinion they should shut that room and use it a storage room not a guest room. 
-TV had the 365 on-demand program but all shows were really old and not much variety.
-I would expect for the absurd amount I paid, to get help with my bag since it was heavy and the room was 2 buildings away from the reception, with stairs to go for the building until you reach the lift of the building, but as usual of this hotel it was disappointing to see that none of the staff cared to offer help with my bag.
-Won’t be staying again. Won’t recommend it for more than one night stay and only if you really have to.","-Location just a few minutes from Earl’s Court underground station was very convenient. 
-The room and bathroom were clean. 
-Well prepared room with tea/coffee facilities, hair dryer and TV, USB and electricity sockets were multiple and well placed around the room for people with multiple devices needing charging.

Great value for money beyond our expectations.

Maybe tsomething they could improve is they do not have a close space to keep the luggage. We really appreciated they took care of our luggage but it felt somehow a little bit unsecure to see it at the lobby just with a chain. Anyway they were looking at that.
The name of the hotel is not clear in the streets in fact to the first part of our trip we booked at the Oxford Hotel and it is the Merit, for the second part of our trip we booked directly at the Merit.","We loved this hotel. We were comparing other options and decided to try this one. Rooms are fantastic, everything is great decor, compfort, design, the bathrooms. Very attentive service.

Luckily we weren't in the room for very long, other than to sleep but I had not appreciated just how small the bedroom was going to be. The bed was a split bed so you slipped through the middle and we couldn't work out the air conditioning and move it from a freezing 16 degrees - brrrrrrr!

Do not book here! The location does not make up for the bad staff!,"We arrived and the guy at reception was hanging in his desk chair like a teenage boy in high school. The were obviously not prepared to welcome a guest (had to look for 5min in a folder for our booking) while it was already 4pm in the afternoon. 
They barely gave us any info or welcoming feeling. 
When entering the room it felt like we took a door straight to the north pole! The A/C was blasting at 18°C. 
Outside our window was a pile of trash bags. When I went up to ask to change rooms, to one without trash in front of the window a man shouted from the other side of the lobby (who I assume was the manager) ""it is just linnen"". 
No new room was given, the bags were moved but the next morning they were back. 
The A/C can't be controlled in the room (even-though there are 2 controllers in the room) but you have to call to reception to ask to change the setting for your room individually. That is if you can guess the receptions phone number, because that is nowhere to be found in the room. 
Just like the wifi password, which can only be found at reception.

We tried to leave the horrible first impression behind us, enjoyed the location and went to bed. At 8AM the next morning the cleaning crew woke us as they had gather outside our window for their morning briefing (this happened again the next morning) 

I have slept in hostels for 4EUR/night where the staff has been better trained than here! Do not book here, it will ruin your stay in London!","The central location, close to shops, the tube and nice restaurants was the only plus of this hotel",3.0,July 2022,"August 1, 2022",Double Room,2,Couple,8

Not pleasant and welcoming guesthouse…,"We were given the room in the basement! The receptionist thought they could fool us with that. The basement room practically without the window. the window opened onto a ventilation shaft and aby sign of sky was 1 floor above us. Fortunately, our complaint was considered positively and we received 1st floor smaller room, but we have to carry our suitcases there and back again…. That is under belt behaviour. Not only the photos on booking.com showed sunny room with window, but also nobody asked us if we wanted that hideous bedroom.
The price a little to high given the tacy that there was no breakfast. But fortunately there are some placem to eat. Very English and interesting food proposal is the Blackbird. We ate there 3 times.","The neighbourhood saved our stay. It was really close to the underground - Earl’s Court stattion , but that’s all…

Highly recommended,"Cons:
1. Slight stain on the beddings  on the second night but did not bother us at all so we didnt report it. It might have been our fault. 
2. Check in - slightly longer process with paperworks to sign because there was only one staff who was doing it. And also because we’re used to having a self check in in other hotels we have stayed in. It was not that bad  and they have asked for £100 security deposit but I didnt mind as some hotels are like that and they gave it back after check out.","Pros:
1. Location - just 1-2mins walk from Earl’s court Tube station: really easy to find; area outside of the hotel was safe even at late night
2.  Room - read reviews that rooms were a bit small but not really it’s bigger than the other hotels we stayed in. really liked the modern feel of the room. Bed was big enough for the two of us. Plenty of space to store luggage in. Nice bathroom. 
3. Price - cheap for the location and the place. 
4. Staff - they are really welcoming and very approachable. Reception staff are also nice esp the one on duty late night. 
5. Turnover service - i really liked that they cleaned the rooms on our second day. Provided fresh towels as well. 
6. Requests - i made a request to put decorations for my husband’s birthday, and they did put lovely rose petals - however they were fake but still appreciated the gesture - thank you

I have never encountered such deposit requirement in my journey. The receptionist says it’s a contract between the hotel and booking so I need to call booking.com to see if they can make a exception.  Turned out booking.com tells me to ask the property provider which is the hotel. Both of you were just avoiding responsibility and putting me who have lived in this Merit hotel for 17 days in 2020 in a confusing situation.

"Great location, but disappointing service and a bit of a mickey mouse operation.","Check-in was not welcoming. The hotel is spread across a few terraced houses on the street - not consequentially, which isn't made clear at all. I arrived at 12 and lugged my luggage up the steps only to be told that reception is actually at 24, so I lug my luggage back down the stairs and down the road and up the stairs again. You're buzzed into a hallway with a desk set up beneath the stairs. A man with a short tone takes your ID details and then requests payment... I haven't even seen the room yet?! During check in there is a woman talking to the ""receptionist"" throughout in another language who clearly works there, but is not in uniform. It is quite mickey mouse in feeling and does not really give you much confidence to be honest. The room (101) is back at number 12 and on the lower ground level, its sold as a single so size is fine but it is right by the ""emergency exit"" to the street at the front of the house so the door - which is lacking a handle on the inside - is constantly slamming closed from guests and staff coming and going. If you are a light sleeper or have issues with noise, do not stay here. The street is quiet but the walls of the hotel are paper thin and it sounds like there is a washing machine that goes on spin cycle constantly, A/C? The bed was lumpy and despite housekeeping coming in and making it daily, it was poorly done with the duvet and pillows straightened but the sheets left loose and not pulled tight. They kept on bringing me new towels despite their supposed ""green"" policy which meant at one point I had 6 towels in my room. In general the housekeeping was poor and inconsistent.

Missleading pictures of the premisses. very samll rooms. Rude Receptionist. Terrible place to stay.,"Missleading pictures of the premisses. The rooms are extremely small. Can not even have a space to open a carry on luggage.  They gave us a room which was built in the garden claiming that we have paid for this room. There is no description of garden room in booking.com page for this hotel. Besides I have paid for a double room. Not a room built in backyard. the door of the room as you will see in the pictures attached is rotten from humidity and patched. No body wants to pay 200 GBP and stay in damp. They do not have any correct desription of the room in Booking.com page. We reserved a room for two people (double room) not a room in the garden or economic room. The receptionist and the manager was very rude. claiming we paid a room in the garden.

"Great location, clean room, but significant improvements needed to facilities!","The lift in building 12 wasn’t working and on speaking to some staff it would seem this has been the situation for a while. Thankfully we were on the first floor, but it was still difficult dragging a case up, and then down, the stairs. There was no offer of help with our cases. Then, once in the room, the air conditioning wasn’t working. This was a big problem as London was experiencing temperatures of 30+ degrees during our 3 day stay. We were advised the system was being reset and would then be fully working. That wasn’t the case! What followed was just a trickle of cold air but the room still averaged 25° at night which was uncomfortable. Reception staff simply advised us to open a window but noise from the main road made for a disturbing nights sleep! During our stay there were several other guests complaining about the lack of air conditioning. The safe in the room also didn’t work. The instructions provided didn’t correspond with the safe and when a member of staff came to look at this, we were advised it was a new safe and they didn’t know how it worked! Finally, we paid £16 per person for breakfast which we found to be very basic and not much choice.","The location of the hotel is in close proximity to Earls Court underground station which made getting around very easy.

I had a really terrible experience. 
I stayed there for 5 nights for work. The cost was well above 200 pounds per night. I have received a room on the last floor. No one mentioned during the check-in that the elevator was broken, and since my room was not in the same building, I discovered that fact only when I came there, already after taking stairs twice from the building of the reception and the my own one. 
I asked several times when the elevator gonna be fixed and every time received an answer "" tomorrow."" When I left, the elevator still did not work. Before check out, I called reception and asked Damian to help me take my luggage down. After climbing to the fourth floor for 5 days, I had terrible back pain and still  got an answer that I had to do it myself.  
When I came to reception,  Damian was there with another colegue, not alone, and no one even thought to apologize for the inconvenience.

Poor,,"Stayed while I was visiting The Chelsea Flower Show with my wife. 
 Property and location were actually very nice. I would have actually have a good review until post check out event’s which is where the problems started. 

Due to a small spill of soft drink on the end of the bed - they charged me €70 directly to my card post check out. The rooms are extremely small and it is easy to knock things over. 

Upon appeal to the hotel, they accused myself and my wife of urinating on the bed. When I challenged this with the truth and asked them to retract the accusation, they then accused us of having multiple opened and unopened beer cans in the room to try and validate their false accusation. They did not repay the money they took. 

In simple terms they charge you a security fee when you check in and then use this to extract more money if there any minor mishaps in the room. 

So if you are planning to book, be very clear of what’s in scope for this security fee, which is not clearly announce when you book and pay in full. Ensure you don’t have any minor spills etc while you are staying or they will charge you large sums of money with no grounds for appeal!

No fun at all! Super TINY bathroom is an eye opener! Deluxe double room? I understand this is London, but still it’s not worth for what I am paying for. A very uncomfortable hotel room. The one facing the street seems better. 
Not recommended for seniors with walking conditions, because you also have to go to the basement for your breakfast. If you don’t want cleaning, you have to set on a daily basis or the light will be off on your door, what a design! Expecting guests remember to turn on and off?! Been in one hotel, also have this kind of system, but once you turn on the light, it lasts for as long as you want until you want someone to clean your room.

"Don’t go, especially if you’re a solo female traveller","Would put 0 stars if I could. Avoid at all costs, and if you go beware of their practices! Only location was ok lol

First there is a 100£ deposit to be made without this being disclosed anywhere. But looking at the room’s quality and size, I am not sure what this deposit is for. Definitely not the standard of a 4 stars hotel at this price!! 

On top of that, staff is rude (especially male staff). I honestly don’t get why they’re working there seeing how rude they are with clients. Don’t ask questions at risk of annoying them and not being helped at all! 

Electricity was not working in my room and I have to shower in a 12 degrees appartement (what am I paying for?).

And worst of all, as a solo female traveller, I didn’t feel safe AT ALL while staying there! When I told them the electricity was not working, they wouldn’t give me a new room. They told me I had to wait for 30min but it was already midnight! They asked me to go back to my room and said they didn’t need to be in the room to fix it. So I went to bed and then someone rang at my door just before 1am. The person insisted on coming in my room to fix the problem!! The second night I’m back late as well only to realise the electricity problem is there AGAIN! They didn’t apologise or did any kind of gesture and I had to have someone again in my room around midnight, alone!

Lastly, I did put the “don’t enter” sign the whole day but I know someone got in my room (without cleaning it!!) because the kettle that I unplugged in the morning was plugged when I came back and I am sure of it. If not for cleaning then why would someone enter my room? I do not trust this hotel AT ALL.

- The lobby was a free-for-all with left luggage... there were dozens of suitcases just out for anyone to take. Guests were routing for their luggage in these piles of luggage. (This completely put us off asking them to hold our luggage)
- There were sweet wrappers on the floor directly under the toilet bowl, suggesting the bathroom floor had not been swept or cleaned properly

What was really disappointing was the response we got from the staff, that was completely inappropriate and rude.
They went from dening any possible alternatives, to writing us in the late morning of the next day telling us that if we wanted a different solution we would have had to come back to the hotel in 15 minutes, to starting arguing with us via email stating false things that other members of the staff allegedly proposed us despite none of them wanted to share their names to allow us to have any kind of reference about who we were discussing with.

We asked to change rooms but they were not able to accommodate this request. The hotel did however send a technician up to check on the smell in the bathroom. He said it might have been the cleaning product. What a joke!! I said I wish I could smell cleaning products, it smells like a  open sespit!!

The bed was such poor quality, from the rock hard springy mattress to the paper thin duvet and pillows. It was like lying down on the street!!

The customer is always wrong in this awful hotel,"The staff and the manager are unlike anything I've ever encountered. They have complete disdain for their customers and no sense of service or honor. They will straight up lie to your face and gaslight you about even the simplest things. Their first reaction is always to reflexively blame the guest.
When our room wasn't cleaned two days in a row they said we must have pushed the do not disturb button. When we told them of silverfish in the sink they said they don't have a pest problem. When we complained repeatedly about the air conditioning they either said it was working fine or we must be pressing the wrong buttons. The broken air conditioning was actually pumping hot air into the tiny room despite being set to 19C, and we couldn't get the temp below 28 degrees, even on cool nights (a KitKat melted).
To fall asleep we had to leave an open basement window which felt unsafe and nasty. We slept under wet towels on the last night because at that point we couldn't even turn off the blasted air conditioning so the open window didn't even help. They will probably respond and say they offered us a room change which they did, but only reactively on the last day when I complained once more, and while also saying that someone was coming to look at the aircon. What they didn't tell us was that the aircon for our floor specifically was broken and they'd known it all along. I learned of this after camping the lobby to talk to the hiding manager post checkout. The manager then admitted the malfunction and said they had been waiting for a spare part to fix the system. I was also there when the maintenance guy came to the lobby and talked about the malfunction, confirming it would be ""warm down there"" until it was fixed.
The manager promised to E mail me to discuss this further (probably just to get me out the door) and never did. I E mailed the hotel after a few days and got a ridiculous response with more lies and deflections.","EDIT 16 AUG:
The hotel has responded to this review with multiple bold faced lies just as expected. 
1. I had two seperate back-to-back bookings because I extended our stay in London by 2 days BEFORE arrival. I would NEVER have extended at the Merit after staying there but was stuck with the booking unfortunately.
2. We were NOT upgraded. We stayed in a tiny basement room the whole time, a classic double which is what we booked I tried to get help on premises multiple times as they well know, but it was impossible and incredibly frustrating as they were consistently dishonest and defensive as outlined in this review below.
3. I didn't ask for compensation upon returning home. I did so in the lobby, in person, TO THE MANAGER. He said he had to get permission from his boss who was in Egypt and that he would E mail me soon after accepting my hand written contact details (what kind of hotel manager doesn't have authority to decide on refunds?)
4. I'm still waiting for a reply from the nameless hotel manager I E mailed on the 19th of July. Maybe he should reply to E mails instead of writing lies about his customers online.

Awful stay,"Never have I ever felt so humiliated and unwelcome in a hotel. I booked this hotel based on positive reviews and the central location.

From the point of check in, the stay has been problematic. I was initially advised that my requested for a mid-floor room away from lifts/stairs was accommodated for. On arrival, the room I got did not meet any of these needs. Luckily, I was allocated a different room.

The second evening, I went downstairs to request a pair of scissors - only to be abruptly advised that I needed to use it on the spot. Well, of course, I wasn't going to take the pair of scissors away from the front desk. The demeanour of William and his front desk colleagues left me absolutely ashamed at the desk. When I called from my room to ask to speak to a Manager, I was refused. William also refused to give me a name to escalate the matter to. So, I have resorted to this review.

My experience of the front desk team has been totally negative. They are unkind, unhelpful, judgemental and quite frankly, lack soft skills.

In my experience, the customer service aspect of a hotel drives people back to its premises. Sadly, this hotel lacks any of that. Shame - because the location is perfect.

Awful,"We were in the courtyard outside in rooms 307 & 308.

Room 308 the plugs did not work and the air conditioning unit would blow cold air but then turn to hot.
Room 307 the air conditioning did not work at all and when they tried to fix it, it still did not work but also made 308 not work either.

On the first day we asked reception to look into this; on our return to the hotel it was still not working, we complained to reception and asked to move rooms, they could not move us, whilst I appreciate the hotel was full, we paid for an air conditioning room and they did not apologise and we had to push to get someone to even try and look at it, someone came to the room to look, pressed the same buttons as we had and said he would be bsck, he did not return, we had also asked for a fan what he said he would go and look for, again he did not return.

The second day of the trip we again asked at reception for them to look into the air con, they did not to our knowledge as that evening it was still not working, we asked multiple times to speak to the manager, there was also others unhappy with not having air conditioning.

As our rooms were next to each other we asked for the adjoining door to be opened to try and spread ventilation.

They would not do this at first, but then agreed.
They also told us not to touch the air conditioning control in our room, but as it was blowing hot air we did for a short while, they then came back and turned it on in room 308 and we had the door open to 307 to air it through, but this meant the people who were in 308 were freezing and the people in 307 were still warm.

The staff throughout were very unhelpful, did not once apologise and made it that it was our fault the air conditioning was not working.

Disappointing,"My Deluxe room  was situated at the basement, literally next to the fire exit, which guests from the same level seemed to have preferred using over the main entrance because there were no stairs to climb. On top of that, the door mechanism works like a magnet to a metal - every time you close the door it slams extremely loudly. Already on the first morning I was woken up at 5am by people who were checking out and had the door got shut in its natural smacking loud way. About 3 hours later, a little past 8AM I was woken up again from the next wall this time. Apparently my room was neighbouring some sort of renovation/carpentry room where workers would always start hammering between 08-08:30am. I cannot understand how thin the walls must be but the noise was unbearable. I banged back on the wall  but of course, that didn't help because the workers are simply doing their job. I was thinking of asking the reception to change my room but I had only few days in London and losing time moving from one room to another when it is ready, usually at 3pm, was very invconvenient and therefore not an option. The renovation work would wake me up every morning with the same hammering and then drilling. But that's provided I didnt get woken up at night by people coming back from the ciry or cleaning ladies coming to work and busing arou d their service room which literally two steps away from my door. On top of that the room is extremely dark, the only window there is facing the exit door where everyone is walking as well as some store units are placed, where service people keep circling. These basement rooms and specifically the ones near the fire exit door and renovation room, should not be even an option to use for clients. Not to even talk about the ridiculous amount of money they charge us.....",The hotel is located right next to a metro station. The bed and the pillows are really comfortable.

We also had a number of special requests unfulfilled. 1) early check-in request was made with a response stating that we were on a ""priority list,"" however when my partner arrived early he was offered a rather dismissive response of ""3.30pm - it might be available earlier but no guarantees"" - leaving him stranded and jetlagged in London. 2) we requested in advance not to be on the ground/basement floor but ended up being in the basement.

Acceptable Rooms with rude and u professional staff,"We arrived on the 18th of December at the Merit Kensington and stayed three nights.
 When we arrived the lobby was literally CROWDED and we were asked to wait outside. Not a problem for me even though it was pouring. When we were finally asked to come in for check-in we were asked to surrender a visa card. When we submitted one  it (somehow) was not compatible with their card reader. But instead of the staying calm.... the staff was really pissed and impatient- not very professional from my point of view since we had already paid 1400£ in advance for our rooms.
After several tries it finally worked.

We had booked three rooms and had asked for them to be close to each other (same floor maybe).  Two rooms, however, were located in the garden and when we asked for a change since we wanted to be close together (and still we had paid good money) eyes were rolled and no effort was made- not professionell AT ALL. I mean even pretend that you are trying....
But after this start the next problem (of course) arose immediately.
In my room the heater was NOT WORKING AT ALL and it was actually really cold outside ( I mean it was December).. I called the reception several times (to politely ask them so send someone to help) until someone FINALLY came to check on it. One man from the reception came and clicked a bit around in our room but (in my opinion) he didn't have a clue what he was actually doing or supposed to do).
After a few minutes he said it was supposed to heat up in 20min which it definitely didn't. We returned after two hours and still it was not working. The room was cold. Since I paid (like already mentioned) good money I was not willing to be cold/freezing in a hotel room in December.  So I tried it again (always polite and kind) to pls help me get the heater on. Now the receptionist was only annoyed and said maybe we are just too stupid to get the heater working- UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I really liked the location of the hotel.

I dont like that they take deposits for the stay, the other two stays in the other 4 star hotels ive been at during the same week, did not ask for deposits.

1 more thing, they took the first night charge days before the day of my booking, even though my booking was under (free cancelation) until a later date. Which was strange to me too. :/

Nice hotel but disappointing service,"I booked a deluxe and paid for that. They assigned a standard. I complained, pictures clearly showed how a deluxe looked like. But they did all they could to deny and convince me of the opposite. They also took me to another deluxe and again it was a deluxe with no light, facing a wall and not matching the pictures available on line. In the end, I had to stay in the standard room as although it was smaller and various things of the deluxe were missing, at least it had a window facing the street and the light. I travel in the industry and I am still able to know how a room I booked should look like. It's a shame as the hotel is a good hotel, but this definitely won't make me come back.
Also, they take a damage deposit of £100 that honestly does not make much sense if you stay one night only and when you leave they do not check or give you any documentation.

worst stay in london,"first of all, When i check in, they said i have a free upgrade but the room does not have elevator! the elevator is out of order! i am travelling with heavy luggage and an elderly. When i climbed the ladder and reached the room, i found other guests luggage is already inside the room. Clearly they have made a mistake. I climbed again and told them what happened. I dont want my mother climb again and i told her to wait at the door first. They said pls wait a moment and they really made a mistake. 

Mistakes happens and i dont think is a big problem. I said: i dont need a upgrade. please just give me a room with elevator. They just asked me to wait without a single apology. The attitude is so bad - feel like i am the one causing trouble

15 mins passed and my mother still waited at the room door. Both of us dont have the progress. i asked whats happening now and they just said wait! i said my mother is waiting at door step. There is no way she climb ups and downs again. They finally get me a room in another building. I said if anyone free and help me to get the luggage into another building (all buildings has door steps in front door). They said sorry i dont have people who can help.   

ok i carry them by myself to another buildings. First, climbing down from one building and up for another building

When i checked out again (heavy rain outside), no staff show any willingness to help when they see guests struggling with luggages in the door steps. Thank you for the gentleman who is another room guest helping me to get through the steps

one of the most horrifying experiences of my life,"I would need a lot of space to really say everything about it, but let me begin by clarifying that I work in the travel industry, and this “hotel” did everything like they were in the past century. 
Starting with the fact that the room maids were going into our room even if we used the non-disturb sign, they even threw away things that we did not clear with them that they should. When we pointed out the inconvenience to the reception, they just said that room maids had to go in whether we liked it or not.
From there, they took our first-night deposit even though here in booking I’ve chosen to pay at the property, and when we decided to check out, they were supposed to refund us for the wrongful payment, but they tried to condition that to the room maids doing a double check in the room. Our checkout was around 6 pm, and room maids would stop working earlier than that, which would mean us only getting the refund on the next day, not being in London anymore. Completely unreasonable policy. I had to insist so that the manager would go to the room and check.
Also, we needed new bedsheets as the room maid while “cleaning” the room put pillows that fell on the floor back on the bed, and we wanted to make sure we were using clean pillows. The receptionist refused to help and finally the manager, totally impolitely, gave us only 2. there were four pillows. 
I mean, the guys were so intrusive and not helpful that I decided to check out earlier and go to another place so that I could keep enjoying my stay in London.
Want a suggestion: don’t stay there!",I’d say the only thing that was interesting about this property was the fact it was close to the subway station so very easy to navigate through London.

disgusting,"utterly terrible. Do not stay here! you’d be better off at a holiday inn. I actually cut my trip short in order to get away from it. 
I was initially checked into the wrong room.. a tiny room in a hell hole of a lower basement that smelt so strongly of chemicals that I dread to think what they were cleaning up. It was impossible to sleep in there. I complained at around 11pm and moved to another room.. which this time smelt strongly of human body odour… as if someone had literally just had sex in it. 
I was just drifting off to sleep (with the window wide open in the middle of winter to rid the place of its foul smell), when the man at reception called at 1am to admit he had actually checked me into the wrong room initially and would not check me into the correct room. I was taken to another disgusting room in the basement which luckily did not smell of anything this time but had a useless patio window that led to a brick wall, a broken mirror, questionable stains and was generally poorly decorated noisy and dire.

In addition, it was noisy all night and hard to get any sleep. And in the morning, due to the room being close to the breakfast place, it was very loud and noisy. The cleanliness and noise were the main issues.

We asked for a room change, however, when we came that night to check-in the other room, it smelled of sewage, there was blood stains on the sheets and pillows (which is is a health hazard), large stains on the mattress, and it had a horrible loud noise coming from the drains/ vents. We talked with the staff and asked for a room change, which they said no to due to rooms in the same class being fully booked. We felt uncomfortable staying in this room and were forced to find other alternatives at 9 pm.

a most pleasant stay,nothing,"Loved everything. proximity to tube station is excellent. it is spotlessly clean.. Reception staff were so nice and helpful. our remote wasn’t working in our room and there was one gentleman on the front desk , this was about 9/10pm and he was up in a few minutes to resolve the matter. very attentive, helpful and pleasant. lovely underfloor heating in the ensuite. Front desk were so accommodating with our luggage as we arrived very early and the same on the day of departure. I could go on and on and all would be positive feedback. we will be back.",10,April 2022,"April 11, 2022",Deluxe Double Room with Extra Bed,1,Family,8

"It was just ok, the single room was quite tight on space",The fact that it was in a different building to the reception area. Not good for people with disabilities or back problems; to have to haul their luggage up the stairs from one building to the next .,Location,5.0,September 2023,"September 2, 2023",Deluxe Single Room,3,Solo traveler,8
Poor,The staff were not very welcoming and came across as rude and very cold. As we were waiting to check in we overheard them talking about other guests who came to the reception to ask simple questions which made us feel uncomfortable. We were upgraded but were on the ground floor on the main road which made us feel unsafe as the window was right on the main road and we could hear other guests throughout the night. The shower in our room was also leaking and we also found ants in the bathroom. Although we were upgraded to what was supposed to be larger than the deluxe double room it was around the size of an average room and the bathroom was very small.,The location was good.,3.0,August 2023,"August 16, 2023",Deluxe Double Room,1,Family,8
