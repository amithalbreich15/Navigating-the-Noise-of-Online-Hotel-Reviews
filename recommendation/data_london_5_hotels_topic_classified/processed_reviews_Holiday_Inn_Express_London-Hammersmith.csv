"Great location, clean and rather large rooms, friendly staff, good value for money. I would return.","The breakfast was bad. Stale croissants, bacon so hard to chew, I had to spit it out. There is a pub next door with excellent breakfast at a good rate so we did not let the lousy breakfast ruin our stay. I would rather pay less and have breakfast elsewhere but the breakfast really was not good at all. Basically, we went next door to the pub, where they offer ""drink as much as you like"" hot drinks for 99p + cheap and made to order breakfast. We spent less than £10 for 2 people daily and we were super happy. So I think if you have just cereal for brekkie, you will be happy at the hotel but if you want bacon or croissant, go next door! 
Shower ""thermostat"" not working = went from set temp to scolding, to cold. That was frustrating. And painful. We did not complain, so they didn't have a chance to offer any solution. We were in room 104. 
Pillows = bricks. Some hotels let you have two pillows (as did this one) but they are different. I would much have preferred a thin and soft pillow.

Hopefully, it was a one off and they were having a bad day! Went down for breakfast at 8am and struggled to find a clean table, there were plenty of tables, but none of them had been cleared from previous customers. The whole self service area is too small for the amount of people using it. The selection of food was very limited. There was a sign to say sorry no eggs today, so a full English consisted of bacon, sausage and beans. The vegetarian cooked breakfast option for my daughter consisted of just beans, the hash browns container was empty and never refilled, when asked I was told they would be out soon, but they never arrived. The fresh orange juice was so watered down it didn't taste like orange. Milk options also very limited, dairy or soya, no oat or almond for people with dairy/ soya intolerance so couldn't have a brew. Overall, very disappointing.","Lovely, clean modern room with twin beds, good size bathroom. Travelling with my daughter, we were very pleased with the room.

Good hotel with potential to become very good.,Staff were functional but not engaging. One of our rooms wasn't marked as ready despite the time being an hour after check in opening.

Ridiculous technology in this day and age and that too in an IHG branded hotel!! Unbelievable!!!!
But since the stay was over Xmas period, parking was free. Also found the street parking around useful (9 to 6 30 PM) so parking after 630pm is free.  There are quite a few streets around that can be used to park.",Breakfast was good; location was great. King's Mall is a walk up the road.

Nice location,The breakfast area is way too crammed for the number of guests on a busy weekend and you thus end up queuing quite a bit. The aircon in the room was too noisy to turn on and a smoker triggered the fire alarm at 2:30 am because they thought they were pushing the entrance door button to get back in. I guess that's not the hotel's fault but there's probably something to review.,The room was of a decent size and definitely big enough for the 4 of us (we had a double bedroom with sofa bed). The breakfast was decent quality. The location was definitely the big plus being a 10 minutes walk from Hammersmith tube station which is on 2 main lines.

A great little find for families with children visiting London.,"The hotel was very good in all aspects, the only thing is at peak breakfast you may struggle to find a seat in the dining room, but the staff are very quick in cleaning and turning around the tables to accommodate. Not the hotels fault, just need to be up when everyone else isn't.","The staff are extremely helpful. The rooms are perfectly serviced, with all the necessary and usual aspects, a decent shower, air conditioning and above all, a very comfortable bed.
The staff prepared the room as requested with no fuss and made our stay as hassle free as anyone could want.
The location was perfect with just a couple of minutes walk to the underground or bus services and plenty of choice for meals nearby too. The evening was also surprisingly quiet making for a good night's sleep without disturbance.
The morning breakfast was delicious with lots of hot/cold options, more than enough to start the day off well.

Pleasant,"Imagine the minimal possible equipment of the room, and you have to divide it at least by two to approach the reality. The room may serve well for a single occupancy for one night. In two, it was difficult to find where to put our things, and there was just one chair with an extremely small table. However, the hotel was populated by families with small children and the kids seemed to be happy there (similarly as my grandson). There is no fridge in the room; it was clear from the description on the web, however, in such an extremely hot days as this year August this was a painful drawback.","Excellent locality, very good breakfast, relatively comfortable bed, everything really clean.",6.0,August 2022,"August 28, 2022",Standard Double Room,3,Family,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

 Morning noise from lorry traffic and nearby construction was unwelcome.  Fire alarm malfunction basically ruined one night's sleep, and was handled poorly by management.  All we received was a brief note describing the initiating event, but no explanation as to why the alarm continued to malfunction at least 4 times in the middle of the night, for at least an hour.  The next morning, word went round that refunds were only being offered to those who registered a complaint; and even then, the initial offer was only 50% refund.  The  proper way to handle this would have been a pro-active, no-questions-asked  refund for the entire evening...instead, HI mgmnt cost the company far more in goodwill than the night's revenue.",5.0,September 2021,"September 24, 2021",Standard Double Room,4,Family,8,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

I would stay here again - the location is great. I would certainly avoid having breakfast here.,"The room and the bathroom were comfortable and what I expected.

I pre-booked breakfast when booking the room and this was a bit of a let down.

The food was cold. I am not sure if the dishes with the cooked items were turned on or if they were gel heated dishes, if they were lit bit the food was really unenjoyable. If I visit here again I will definitely avoid the breakfast.

I appreciate it is a busy hotel and it is difficult to gauge when guests will come to breakfast however this is a real let down for this hotel.

The area that breakfast was laid out in was too small to handle the volume of people using it which causes an uncomfortable experience for guests.

Pleasant,"Room - a little tired especially bathroom decor...toilet / cistern although functioning difficult to flush. Shower tray very flimsy.
Staff response when hair dryer was reported faulty was poor at best. Initially my wife discovered this fault after getting out of the shower. The phone in the room was faulty so she walked to reception via stairwell to report the matter. The female receptionist agreed that the hairdryer did not sound healthy but said it was working. On my wifes return to the room sporting wet hair with the 'unhealthy sounding' hairdryer then completely malfunctioned. I walked to reception 3 flights as only one elevator was working and it was naturally trying to cope with the traffic capacity of two. I brought the broken hairdryer to the same female receptionist and reported the issue & the faulty phone. 
We waited 18 minutes for a replacement to arrive and when it did not arrive at our room I walked to reception again via stairwell - meanwhile my wife was sitting with wet hair. I reiterated my complaint regarding the hairdryer and a few minutes later a replacement was delivered to the room. 
We appreciate that it is a 3 star establishment but cannot fathom why the hairdryer could not be replaced when initially brought to the receptionist attention but was only addressed 20+minutes later. Although a maintenace man did try to fix the phone it remained faulty for the duration of our 3 day stay.","Breakfast good, location good.

Lees mijn volledig verslag dat ik eerder aan u en het hotel heb toegestuuurd.,"Ontbijt, kamer en verdwenen juwelenGood morning Mrs/Mr Robel Kahsay and Mrs Karin Sheppard Managing director Europe.
After a week of staying in your Hotel I want to inform you the following.
We are quite disappointed about the condition and the service of this/your hotel.
For  £ 1568,93 = £ 224,13 per day you get a room where you hardly can turn yourself with only one grubby chair where the other person has to sit on the bed.
The paving tiles in the bathroom are lying loose and you can only open the window when you remove one of the beds. 
The breakfast is very poor (also quality), insufficient choices (filling) and or missing croissants.
On top of it we are missing a very little square blue jewellery box were you put earrings etc. 
Inside this little box were two pair of earrings. 
One pair large white pearl hangers and one pair small round white gold ones with diamonds.
I don’t believe we forgot to take is with us but if you have found it, it would be nice of course (ROOM 338)
However we presume it has been taken away out of the small black rolling case we had with us.
(this must have taken place after 26th of May, because they were used then) 
Yes that’s what is missing also in this room: THE SAFE.
Well  there was one behind the concierge, but that was a place where everybody could get in.
Sorry to say so but never again to Holiday Inn In Hammersmith 
With regards

"A good 'basic hotel' in a good place with comfy beds, a bit run down and breakfast not great","The cooked breakfast was not edible.  We both had a cooked breakfast from the buffet that we both left completely uneaten because it was cold, we couldn't cut into the sausages and generally it was not nice at all.

wouldn’t stay here again,"we didn’t have a great stay.

For 3 days the hotel is fine. But not more than that.,"The breakfast was quite poor. I would expect more from a Holiday Inn 3-star hotel. Mainly sausages, baked beans , scrambled eggs and bacon. There were also some yogurt, bread/croissants and a few fruits however no cheese, no turkey/chicken slices and no vegetables. The breakfast in general was quite fatty, most of the products I described above were quite unhealthy. Eventhough you are in England, the breakfast should be international.

Moreover, I found a hair in one of the two yogurt bowls and also the mug for coffee/tea were not that clean.

Another thing I didn't like was that the sockets in the rooms which were British type with no adaptors for international ones and you had to use a USB cable to charge your phone or buy an adaptor in case you want to charge your laptop.","The location was quite good and quite, near (5' walk) to both Hammersmith and Ravenscourt Park tube stations.

Never again,"Reception were beyond awful. Was first told abruptly by a woman we walked up to that her shift was over so we had to see someone else. After waiting for another person, I was met with total rudeness (when I asked what time breakfast was until, she said that she’d address that when it’s time (though never did). I had to ask if there was something wrong because of the way she was speaking to me, to which she argued she had done nothing wrong. I sent a message to the hotel through this app asking them to review the cctv footage of her appalling demeanour - zero response received… 

This was before we got to the room. There were sticky marks on the surfaces and a really dirty air vent in the bathroom with a broken door handle… for the price, you’re better to stay in Chiswick or Richmond and travel a little further - honestly the worst hotel I’ve stayed in and certainly not worthy of the Holiday Inn brand.

Breakfast was mediocre for my taste. The variety was poor and the quality and taste were unsatisfying compared to similar hotels in Europe(this may be the standard for UK)
The worst of all was the higene. The ""clean"" glasses were visibly stained with tea/coffee. I found a big peace of plastic in the omlette(it was removed by a staff member who apologised). The staff who cleans up the tables walks around with a cart with the rests of food poured in bowls and even worse, the rests of liquids(tea, coffe, orange juice) poured in something that resembles a night potty that is extremely dirty.

That was a very dark room which made reading uncomfortable. 
The shower suddenly changed temperature of water to very hot or suddenly to very cold!
The breakfast was monotonous - each day the same sausages, bacon and scrambled eggs. If you do not like it, you will have no other cooked food options. No vegetables at all. No cheese or ham. No hashbrowns, mushrooms or porched eggs. No decaf tea. Very disappointing.
I bought food in a supermarket and left it in the room. When I returned after the room cleaning, my bottle of water and sugar disappeared. Nothing was left to replace them.

If this is the standard of Holiday Inn Express today - look elsewhere.,"Upon entering the room, it was cold. 

The carpet was stained. 
The vent in the bathroom was not functioning.
There was mould in the shower area. 
 
They had used dropped ceiling tiles to cover the installation of the air conditioning system. These dropped ceiling tiles are something you would find in a commercial property such as an office block. I have never seen such an installation for a hotel room. 

Air conditioning was not operating at full capacity - hardly noticed any air conditioning activating when we set it to the maximum temperature to heat the room. 

I went to check the radiator and found that they had no working radiator attached to the wall but a small plug in radiator. The plug of this small radiator became hot quite quickly and we had to turn it off. 

The duvet provided was thin. I requested a second duvet at reception later in the evening. The night manager on duty initially tried to brush me off and told me to just turn up the heating. I had to communicate to the night manager that I was cold and I needed it. I don’t think it is an unreasonable request to be warm in a room you are staying in. We were able to obtain a second duvet approximately 30 minutes later.

Both the hotel and the area have seen better times. Okay if you are on a tight budget,"I can't understand many of the other reviews here. 
This hotel is tired. Old decor, tired 90's carpets and curtains. Holes in towels. Sink that didn't drain properly. 
One lift was out of operation the days we stayed.
The hotel backs directly onto train tracks (see pics for my window view. My bed was literally a few meters away from the tube line). Sound proofing is ok but you will be woken up if you have a room at the back of the hotel and you are a light sleeper.
Breakfast area and buffet does not have capacity. Signs warn guests not to attend breakfast at certain times otherwise queues form. Food available is ok but very limited in choice.
Hammersmith itself is not a very pleasant part of London. The hotel is down a side road next to a wetherspoons pub and off a high street which is fairly depressing (drunks, drugs, homeless, litter).

This is a budget hotel but is very expensive for what you get. There are better places than this. If you can choose to stay in a different part of London or you can stretch your budget a bit , I'd really recommend doing so.",Staff were very polite and reception had good capacity for check in/out.

Not very secure as anyone could come in from the street and steal someone's luggage.","Bedrooms clean and comfy , no sound from surrounding area and air con worked which was lovely when it was warm all day. Good access to tube lines and bit out of town so ideal away from the hussle and bussle of the city centre. Nice little high street with shops for food and drinks.",6.0,September 2021,"September 13, 2021",Standard Double Room with Sofa Bed,2,Family,8,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0
Disappointing hotel,Mattress has a big dip in it. Very uncomfortable to sleep in. The shower was scalding hot and then freezing cold. The tiles had gaps in them. Difficult to get the right temperature In The room. There was a flickering light which meant I had to keep the light off as it could trigger a migraine.  No water in the taps at 11 a m  even though checkout was confirmed to be at 12.,Staff were friendly. Reasonable location.
