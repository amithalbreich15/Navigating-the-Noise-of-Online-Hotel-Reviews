Manage your expectations in this place,"The floor was very dirty when I arrived and the smell of the place wasn't pleasing as well. It looks like it was not vacuumed at all! Our room was located in the basement and there is a door for the outside terrace-ish and it looks so dirty, unkempt and full of pulp of cigars that hasn't been swept. Kettle and disorganized sachets of coffee, tea and sugar was available at the bedside. The ceiling of the room was mouldy and needs repainting. Curtains looks dirty as well. The room should have been cleaned and tidied at least. Wi-fi signal wasn't that great either as it was only 1bar of signal can reach the basemen and sometimes none. It was not a pleasant place to say. Good thing we just stayed for 5hours here as it was just for sleeping purposes and getting ready for the next day. Not ideal to book this place if you intend to stay longer than 1 night.","I already managed my expectations when I read the reviews prior to booking this property as its within our budget range. The only things I liked was the early check-in time and the private bathroom that was available inside the room. Check-in time was supposed to be at 3pm but I was in the area early and was able to check-in. The private bathroom was okay and looks newly renovated compared to the room itself which looked dusty, mouldy and very much unclean. The bathroom is too small though so you have to manage your expectations for this price range.",1.0,March 2022,"March 24, 2022",Double Room,1,Group,3.9,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0018518238159692022

would stay again as very convenient and within budget!,"unfortunately the bed was falling to pieces, needs screwing back together. at best. The main most important issue was that there was black mould(very dangerous for respiratory) on the bathroom ceiling and windows - this can be remedied very easily with Mould & Mildew remover from Tesco etc. the expel-air fan in bathroom needs a jolly good hoover!

Give this hotel a miss.,"Firstly there was no sink plug in the sink, The toilet bowl has not been cleaned in ages it would appear so I cleaned it myself. The frame of the bed appears to have been replaced but with shoddy workmanship blocks of cheap wood were holding the bed up. The net curtains are filthy as were the curtains. We were out the room for a few hours and I think our shower room was cleaned leaving the carpet outside soaking wet and when we took our shoes off on our return or socks were totally soaked. Finally in the morning there wasn't enough sugar in the room so I asked for some more sugar or preferably Sweetner, he never came back to me at all. The pillows were very thin, cheapest pillows possible and I had to fold it in two to get any comfort. I will definitely never stay at this hotel again and will not recommend to anyone.

The most horrible experience I've ever had,"To start with, the check in and check out is a disaster, there is no one in the reception and everything that we needed to discuss we barely found someone there to help us! 

The room is TOO small, you cannot walk around the BED, the carpet was TOO old we could smell the mold all the time, and there is a problem with the shower, so there is a leak and the shower it's like a sprinkler, so the toilet after a shower looks like a swimm pool. 

The BED was so so so BAD, we couldn't barely sleep, I could feel the springs in the old mattress, I would like to invite the owner or the manager of that place to sleep at least one single night in that BED, that BED was too unconfortable, I believe for the price that we paid which it was 168 euros per 2nights, they could save at least 4 booking days and afford a better mattress because that one, I wouldn't never ever leave one friend of mine sleeping in that thing.

There was a HORRIBLE smell from the toilet and it was discusting, you cannot sleep with the toilet's door opened, and the smell of the sanitary pipes was driving us insane!

I usually do not complain when I stay in a ""cheap hotel"", but I have to at this time, because there is no excuses for what they offered for us, and this also can help people to find better places to stay in, I am so sad that we couldn't sleep properly, and I believe that sleeping at the airport, would be better choice than staying in Daisy Hotel.",The only good thing was the location!

Worst hotel I have ever seen!!!!!,"I don’t even know where to start with this “hotel”. It should be condemned! 
How this place can even be open is beyond me. 
It’s -3 degrees and the steps up to the door are steep… iced over. They haven’t been gritted, not a promising start. 
When we arrived we were told to wait so they can check our room is ready (which is the most laughable thing, there was nothing “ready” about this room). 
We walked up to level 3, the stairs were incredibly steep and walking up with luggage wasn’t ideal. The place smelt like cigarettes and the walls looked like they were going to come down.
Walk into the room and the smell of smoke hit hard! The smoke detector is covered with a plastic wrap… how was this not seen when the room was being made ready? The curtains are grotty and covered in yellow marks, the walls had marks and pen drawings on them, side cabinet was broken, lights flickered, the bathroom was filthy, cups dirty, tv broken, walls cracked and the bed BROKEN, being fixed up by some wood, it creaked all night, there was a bar sticking out, the springs in the mattress stuck in you like needles, it dipped In the middle, and only 1 pillow.

- Room was a damp with horrible smell.
- NOT clean.
- Heating NOT working.
- Shower drain clogged +++ with water overflowing.
- Minimal light.
- While opening the curtains, the bar got detached and my bother was asked to pay £10 (please see the state of the blinds).

Just don't.,"We bookended our holiday here, so stayed twice, sampling both the basement rooms.   First impression as you wrench the outside door open is that they haven't finished building it.   Scruffy carpet with odd offcuts covering (presumably) holes and odd bits of electrical equipment on the floor.   Narrow doors which don't open fully - the one towards the basement has a lump of 2"" x 2"" fastened to it to hold it half way open.   Steep and narrow stairs not easy with luggage.  Receptionist crammed in a tiny cupboard with a small sliding window to see you as you walk past.

Basement room 1 would be a decent double but had a third bed crammed in.   This bed didn't fold up, but someone had tried to fold it anyway.   Milk in the heap of packets by the kettle was 3 months out of date. Most of the TV channels didn't work.   No decoration in the room, only odd splashes on the walls which hadn't been cleaned off.    Bathroom was probably OK but the bulb was so faint you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.   Only one light worked.

A week later, basement room 2 was the lowlight of the whole experience.   A single room with double bed shoehorned in.  This clearly left no room for the wardrobe and TV which were explicitly mentioned in the booking. Holes in the plaster.    Daren't fill the kettle as the shelf it was on would have collapsed.   Only one mug provided - when we asked for another the receptionist told us she was having to give her own to another guest who didn't have one at all and there were no more. Bed was as uncomfortable as I have ever experienced.   Stains on the walls were damp - in fact the walls were wet along one corner.   We only saw the ants in the carpet as we were leaving.   Bathroom had been refurbished and was clean, but anyone even slightly ample wouldn't be able to squeeze part the sink to use the toilet.

Disgusting and booking.com compensation process is totally flawed,"You can see from the photos just how horrible the room was with a door that wouldn't lock leading out into what I can only describe as a rubbish tip of bags, cigarettes, coffee cups and I don't even want to know what else. This was literally the other side of the glass from the bed. The room itself stank of nicotine, there was blood on the duvet and yellow stains on the towel they provided. The wall had multiple holes drilled and the only side table had not been wiped for a long time. I had to leave the hotel and check into another one at 11:05 at night in Kings Cross so the whole experience was quite frankly a disgrace.

The hotel was disgusting and unhygienic and booking.com should be embarrassed to sell rooms here and should also have a policy to protect your PAYING customers who experience such a horrible situation when booking through YOUR platform. I cannot believe their policy is to only offer a refund IF the property manager agrees to it. The girl on reception even said the manager does not care about feedback as they can fill the rooms night after night with no problem. She also said many guests ""...arrive with a smile but leave with unhappy faces"". This shows you how the manager behaves so they will never agree to a refund because they obviously do not care about their own paying guests. Booking.com should charge them and refund me the full amount for both nights I booked.

Update:
Booking.com has credited me just £8.10!! They said they can't refund the whole lot because the property manager has not approved a refund which is no surprise at all ""First and foremost, please accept my apologies for having to witness such an experience with your booking.

I couldn’t stay in the room as temperature outside was minus and room was getting cold esp as it was at the top floor! I also couldn’t charge my phone so my phone battery was flat and I had to ask to charge my phone at reception. Yes it was this bad!!

After entering, a man was sat in a small cupboard. His English was interesting but seems troubled with the process of my arrival.

My room was clean, I think it was clean. I checked my bedding and towels. Something was not quite right.

The floor was not clean, I found wrappers, a T-shirt lol. 

Popped open the window, turned the TV on ( 3 kids channels and a random channel showing old re runs)

The bed, 

It was being help together with a wooded beam, I actually feel sorry for it.
