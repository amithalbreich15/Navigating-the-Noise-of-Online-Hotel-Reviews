Great location!,"Despite the ""no smoking"" signs in the hotel, there is still obvious cigarette smells in various places (e.g., the corridor when I exit my room on level 6, the washroom in the hotel lobby). Housekeeping occasionally forgets to replace things that we have used (wet wipes, body soap). The walls in the room are thin and lack soundproofing - you can definitely hear when the guests in the room next to yours have their tap/shower running, and you can hear anyone talking in the corridor outside your door. Strangely, the volume of the TV is automatically reset to a really high volume every time we turn the TV off and on.

The pastries provided at breakfast should have something covering them - I have seen numerous guests sneeze onto the pastries which are all exposed on the table. The noodle station at breakfast is rather chaotic, seems like the chef doesn't remember most orders (I repeated my order in Chinese to him three times and he acknowledged & repeated back to me each time yet he still gave me the wrong bowl).","Staff are pleasant. Location is fantastic - there are bus stops nearby where the buses lead to common areas of the city (e.g., Guomao, Hu-Tongs, Yong He Gong, and many train stations). It is also a walkable distance to 2 train stations (one of which is a direct airport express line), and to dining areas like So-Ho. There are also various affordable eateries and supermarkets. There is a fantastic pizza place called Saporita that is an 8min walk from the hotel.

Nice place but with some mayor inconveniences,"There were some major issues that I encountered:
1) There is NO Hotel bar, honestly as a solo Traveller who does not speak Chinese that was a huge downer, as it’s neither easily to get around and nor convenient to simply go to a Chinese bar. 
2) Privacy: I had two encounters at my room. First at around 10 pm a guy tried to open my door. Apparently it was another guest who was told that my room is his room, as my room number was written on his card. Luckily he couldn’t enter my room and the issue was easily solved, however, that should not happen. Second, and worse, they one day removed my sofa (with out any prior notice), I was a bit confused but I thought maybe they need it in another room. When I took an afternoon nap suddenly somebody from the hotel entered my room (without any knocking) and shouted at me in Chinese. I told him multiple times that I do not understand a word but he wouldn’t go away, turned out he wanted to return the sofa.
3) Breakfast: There is breakfast but it’s not really worth to be called continental. If you like lunch for you breakfast you’ll love it, otherwise not so much. 
4) English skills: The staff at the lobby always tries its best to assist in English, however, it is just not convenient and very hard to get to the point. 
5) I asked for a late check out which they offered to me at twice the nightly rate (?). I am not sure whether that was a misunderstanding but confusing. I decided to reach out to the hotel in English via booking.com and never received an answer, even though it was two days before the checkout.",the rooms look like on the picture and everything is clean. the staff tries its best to help in English,6.0,June 2023,"June 17, 2023",1 Queen Standard Air Purifier,8,Solo traveler,8.8,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0.0014343120683902235

Disappointing,"I have never written a single negative review for a hotel before but my experience at this Holiday Inn was beyond terrible.

The hotel uses robots to dispense deliveries and promises that no customer need to go downstairs to pick ‘em up. However, the promise that you can scan the QR code to reserve for the robots and track the delivery routes are misleading as they do not apply to *ALL DELIVERIES* but only the ones from their own grocery shop.

This could’ve explained for the first 45 minutes (from 9:43pm to 10:28pm) during which I waited for my delivery to be dispatched to my room. During the wait, I called at 10:05pm to ask about eta and i got the impatient answer of “5-10 more minutes.” And when I called again at 10:28pm, the answer turned into “we had checked both the storage table and the security camera, and there was no delivery for the room number you have provided.”

And what’s worse, after I placed a second order for the same exact item which arrived at 11:10pm, I got *TWO DELIVERIES* with the robot for this time. Before I received the delivery, *NO ONE* called me in advance to let me know about the *SURPRISE* finding of my previous delivery. And instead, I have to call the front desk and ask how and when they found my earlier delivery and why I was only notified then.

To sum it up, I am just purely astonished at how unprofessionally the staff team has handled this whole delivery situation.

1’ The most concerning part is that the staff member seems to be conveniently outsourcing their own problems to other parties. If my delivery didn’t magically reappear, my delivery person would be taking the false responsibility of “never showing up in the security camera.” Or, I would be taking the false responsibility of “not obligating the delivery person to take a photo of where he left the item.",,4.0,August 2023,"August 27, 2023",1 Queen Standard Air Purifier,2,Solo traveler,8.8,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0.0007640531355169798

- Breakfast does not include Western food. There is a large focus on Chinese food only, even though a large number of guests are foreigners!  
- The receptionists are not good with English language , and this is a big problem because twice they give me locations for important tourist places, and when I give them to the taxi driver, he takes me to another place, which makes me forced to pay for the wrong place and then pay for the delivery to the right place..
