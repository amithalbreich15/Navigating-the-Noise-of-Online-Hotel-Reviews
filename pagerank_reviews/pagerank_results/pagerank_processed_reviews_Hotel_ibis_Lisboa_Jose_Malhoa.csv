A good and practical choice for a cost effective short break in beautiful Lisbon.,The low pressure shower was disappointing (more  like home in Britain rather than the European norm) but that may have just been my room and nothing to rant to reception about.,Im quite happy staying with Ibis and this was no different. You know what you’re getting and it was clean.  The staff were super friendly and efficient. The location was convenient not in the centre of the city but about 10 minutes by metro from the main areas. The walk to the metro station is easy but quite lonely even during the day time. Its close to the airport so there is some flight noise but the advantage is that any car transfer doesn‘t involve crossing the city (which can be interesting during rush hours). For travellers who don’t need everything right in front of the door and are happy to jump on public transport this is a good location. There is a buffet style continental breakfast served til 12 noon nothing fancy but fine for setting yourself up for the day. Book it when you get there as I was much cheaper at the hotel than booking in advance.,8.0,October 2023,"October 27, 2023",Standard Double Room,2,Solo traveler,8,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0020315158560321863
A good hotel for the price.,"The hotel is near the airport and you can sometimes hear the planes landing.

Excellent comfortable stay. Convenient location.,A kettle in the room would be nice.,"Very clean and comfortable, quiet room. Bed is comfortable. Body wash and shampoo with conditioner provided. Great, efficient and friendly staff. Checkin was quick. Ana at the reception did an amazing job for my check in. Convenient  location. Good breakfast for a reasonable price. Close by to supermarkets, restaurants, pharmacy, and Cafes. Walking 10 mins distance to the Sete Rios bus/train station, metro station (Jardim Zoological) -10 mins train ride to city cente. Would definitely recommend to my friends and family to stay here.",10.0,September 2022,"September 22, 2022",Standard Double Room,9,Solo traveler,8,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0020315158560321863
Very Good,"The room only had a small window yet a huge curtain covering the wall and taking up space. I could not figure that out. Space was a limited resource in the room, so the counter space blocked by the curtain was annoying.","Location was close to two metro locations. It was a pleasant walk to the main shopping street and close to a couple grocery stores. Room always felt clean, staff were all very nice and helpful, and the included breakfast was great.

"I would stay again, thank you!",The rooms were absolutely basic. I could use an electric kettle and a small refrigerator. Some vegetables for breakfast would be nice.,"Excellent service at the reception, very helpful, patient, always ready to help.
Location very close to the metro station in beautiful, green area, some nice restaurants and grocery shops nearby.
Breakfast was very tasty with good variety of products, including cheese, ham, eggs, yogurts and cakes. Comfortable beds, spotlessly clean rooms.",9.0,April 2023,"May 7, 2023",Standard Double Room,5,Solo traveler,8,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0.0020032068346939975
It was ok. I liked the location of the Hotel which was close to the Metro station.,"You hear the airplanes every 3 minutes as if they are in your room. So, it is loud. Bring your earplugs with you. Since it is a big hotel, there are lots of guests who do not know how to behave in a hotel. You can hear door slamming and laughter on the corridor of the Hotel.","We liked the location of the Hotel. It is very close to the Metro station Praha de Espana. The room was very clean. Our check-in and check-out were also very quick. The staff is helpful and professional. Breakfast was ok, however, the coffee offered in the breakfast room is terrible.",7.0,September 2022,"September 23, 2022",Standard Double Room,4,Couple,8,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0020016302637398536
Tidy rooms in Lisbon,The room size was pretty small even for a budget hotel. Parking price could have been a tad cheaper,The staff are very professional and polite. The location is decent amidst a range of hotels nearby. The rooms were clean and the buffet breakfast was good. Paid parking available on site. The rooms were neat and tidy. A metro connection under 10 minute walk was quite convenient.,8.0,May 2024,"May 31, 2024",Standard Double Room,2,Family,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0019916317622553138
Overall I’ll give a 9/10 because it just keeps up to what they promise. They have got the main things with is: locke,"- Breakfast was not that great. Me and my husband payed 8.50 euros per person ( I think) for one day just to try it and it had croissants, bread, butter, ham, cheese and few other things like Pastel de Nata but it wasn’t that good. You have to make your own orange juice which I think was unhygienic as I saw people touching the spinning thing of the juicer with their hands. We did miss a good toast with sausage and bacon but, you know, it’s Portugal and this is not the culture, so it’s fine. Overall I’d give it a solid 6/10 for the breakfast.
- I wish they had more plugs in the rooms cause as far as I know there was just one extension with a couple plugs.
- The aircon could be stronger but it still sufficed and made us fresh in this hot august weather.
- Hairdryer could be better and stronger but it still worked.
- Wifi is good but not good if you need to attend a meeting when working remote.
- Didn’t have an iron in the bedroom but I’m pretty sure you can ask for it (I didn’t use it) and no mini fridge (which would have been really useful) but apparently you can store things in a fridge in the common areas upon request (I also didn’t check that).","- Staff very kind and helpful. We lost our keys once and forgot the keys inside another time and they took care of it in less than a minute.
- 24/7 bar and reception and it made us feel really safe whilst having a smoke outside, waiting for food delivery or waiting for an Uber.
- The location is in a really safe area (not that close to the city centre but you can easily get a 7 euro uber there).
- They have locks inside of the room that you can only lock from inside, good for solo travellers and girls specially that want to feel safer, no need to bring that extra locker.
- Bathroom, room, bed and bedding, everything super clean and they have got shampoo/conditioner, body wash and hand soap for you.
- Bed really comfy and not noisy
- They have got lockers if you need to keep your bag there if you check out but you only leave at night for example.
- walls are not that thin so you don’t really hear everyone.",9.0,August 2023,"August 14, 2023",Standard Double Room,6,Couple,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0.0019896560643606885
Pleasant,"Unfortunately, very noisy outside until late at night and low-flying planes, it's hard to sleep - but the hotel staff has no influence on this. ;( However, in the room to fix the door to the bathroom - the lock (you have to slam hard to close), and the magnetic lock to enter door - poorly reads the magnetic card. Many tries required.","Good location, close to the subway.

Clean and comfortable apartments in a great location.,"Unfortunately lift was not in service for the most part of our stay.
One room did not have an AC - it got a bit warm - would have been nice if they had informed us earlier.
There is construction still going on next door - not too much of an issue, but there is dust and noise during the day time.","Super friendly staff.

Definitely our go-to hotel chain around Portugal,"We couldn't open the window and at the reception we were told nothing could be done until the morning (understandable since we were back to the hotel at about 2am) but the AC was also not working so the room got way too warm.
Also, in the elevators it says the restaurant runs 24/7, however when we asked about food options (at about 2am) the only thing available was toast. Again, understandable considering the time, but the info is a bit misleading. We were under the impression we could buy something at the hotel when back from a night out and that wasn't the case.

Good place worth its money,"We enjoyed everything, however if you are sensitive to noise or are afraid of aeroplanes, you may opt the area out. This is because of the landing route of aeroplanes in Lisbon -  every plane landing in Lisbon would literally fly over the hotel roof quote close to the ground. This causes noise. This calms however down at night. However, if you are fascinated by watching planes, this disadvantage can turn into advantage =)","The room: the room was as pictured - a big comfy single bed, a corner wardrobe, a desk and a mini sitting area at the corner, and a TV. The shower was good with a good temperature and great water flow. It was nothing fancy but very comfortable, and we did not need to spend much time indoors as Lisbon was magnificent and worth spending the whole day out. 
The hotel and breakfast: the staff was very welcoming, and the hotel was clean. The breakfast had a few cheese and salami varieties, eggs, yoghurt with toppings, pastries including pasteis de nata, juices, coffee, and fruits.

Not good value for the price - has some good features but could do a lot better.,"The reception team were not very interested, and a little distracted.  The mattress and particularly the pillows were really uncomfortable so we didn´t have a good night´s sleep - if they had been better we would definitely have enjoyed our stay a lot more.  The breakfast was pretty limited, as was the evening menu (all microwaved food).  Not that it could be helped of course, but the hotel is directly underneath the flight path for the airport and the windows are not particularly soundproofed.  The hotel in general felt a bit tired and run down.  We were staying in that part of Lisbon as we had an appointment nearby.  As we presume this is mainly a transit hotel (it´s very close to the airport), the hotel does not succeed in providing a good night´s rest and something tasty and filling to eat.  We have previously stayed in Ibis hotels on route to destinations in other countries and every one of them has been much better than this one for value and comfort.",Hotel was in a great location for our purposes.

Disappointing.,Initially when we arrived at the reception the staff asked to change to room to another room than we were allocated earlier. As the staff mentioned that the room is same we changed it without thinking. We just dropped our luggage and went out to visit the city. All hell broke loose when we came back to the hotel. The room was stinking like crazy and the room had a very negative and depressing vibe. The smell was so bad that we decided shorten our stay from 3 night to 1 night. I requested the night staff to change our room but the staff did not provide another room during the first request. I thought of settling down in the room but the smell was so bad that we could not stand it. Again I requested the staff to change the room and told that we are going to leave the hotel as next day. The staff understood the gravity of the problem and arranged another better room for 1 night. Eventually we moved to another hotel the next day.

We hardly slept during our stay as the room was crazy hot in February (30+ degrees, even when we kept the curtains shut all day). I can't imagine how this hotel is in the summer. We complained more than once and were told to come back later. As the reason for our stay was a family urgency (as explained at reception) this was less than ideal.

Also, the hotel is pet friendly but upon arrival I was told to pay a supplement of 15,- a day which should've been mentioned in the property description.

Disappointed with the state of IBIS Lisboa Jose Malhoa,"NO WATER PRESSURE: Stayed on the 12 floor, had to jump around the shower to get wet (No pressure at all).

AIR CONDITIONER NOT WORKING/NO STENGTH: We were then moved to the 2nd floor, shower pressure was good but air conditioner had no strength, or this is what we were told by the Maintenace/Service gentlemen. This room was hot and would take a long time to cool down. So Maintenace/Service gentlemen asked that we move once again. (ROOM - not sure of room number)

BED BUG: We were then moved to the 7th floor. Water pressure and air conditioner was good at last. At 4am was woken by something biting me on my neck.  I thought it was a mosquito but was shocked to find that it was a bed bug. 
IBIS group can't afford to have bed bugs in one of their branches - health risk. Not sure if it was because I used the spare cushion. (ROOM 713)

Be careful that staff will change your card currency at the place to overcharge you!,"1.

That was a fraudulent way to overcharge me. Because I use Wise to avoid that situations where I don't need to pay in Swedish to avoid expensive charges from the locals. 

I never had that problem again, the rest of the Portugueses let me choose in all types of shops where I buy my chosen currency - EURO. So that I avoided extra charges, but that bitter moment made me not to choose that hotel again in the future and I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.
