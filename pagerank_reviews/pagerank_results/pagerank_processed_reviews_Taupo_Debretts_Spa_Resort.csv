Villa 1,"Kitchen needed a deep clean not just a wipe down. Sofa had no support left and was very uncomfortable. Oven tempreture and settings worn off so tricky to use.

Hot pools and waterslide fun in,"I sounds funny but I would have liked a better dish soap be provided, one that cuts grease better. It seems common throughout New Zealand to use weak dish soap, so all the dishes feel greasy. They could also use some kind of shelf in the shower, to put shampoo onto, vs the floor of the shower.","The room was large  and  comfortable with  a lovely private deck backing  onto a green space.

Relaxing Getaway.,"The beds could've been a little comfortable but overall, we didn't mind.  Also, we were unaware with the change of fresh towels.  It only stated that replacement towels will be provided when using the pool facilities which we never used throughout our stay.  I just find it rather disappointing when cleaners were servicing all the rooms onsite.  A better understanding or explanation would've been helpful.","The location was superb, especially the scenic view of the lake and mountains from the deck.

Enjoyable stay,"Upon arrival it did not look clean and that could be because the facilities are quite old. I noticed a few cob webs in the corners of the room. 
I had to question the daily service with the staff as the info said one thing but what we received was different. Why advise beds will be made if they aren't? I did what was instructed. Why would you not provide towels for all guests? I also noticed no extra blankets were available in the rooms.",I liked how family friendly the facilities are and the location. It's not too far from town and eating places. I liked the size as it was big enough space for a family of five.

Will look forward to coming again and again if offered a more ‘quiet and private’ option!,The room was excellent but the privacy was not so great. Other cabins looked directly into #5 and closing curtains was the only option. The adjoining room was also VERY NOISY. We heard parents screaming at kids and kids jumping on beds and crashing around in their kitchen. That was a bit disappointing. Check aircon regularly…it smelt weird.,"Loved the double glazing in the room - very cozy at night. Spacious. All we needed was provided for dining/ cooking gear, good supply of hot drink selection and towel service were superb. Cleanliness was good and I’m super fussy in that aspect.

Good,"Everything else was quite nice, but the cabin we were staying in was probably also a family cabin, with a door separating the two rooms. As we were just 2 people, the other part of the cabin was rented to another group. The door separating the two spaces was locked, but there was no insulation of course which made it feel like there was no privacy. I was woken up during the night by someone in the other room snoring.","Staff was very vriendly, on-site parking, cute cabin, clean.",7.0,February 2024,"February 18, 2024",Basic Double Room with Shared Bathroom,1,Couple,8.3,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0006385003857419881
pleasant enjoyable and comfortable will be back.,"I was allocated a car park which was taken by my neighbours the evening prior to my departure.  When I approached them to ask to move as we were leaving early and needed to load bags and bikes they were not please and grumbled.  Even checking on who owned the car was a mission which wasn't well received by anyone. 
It seems the parking policy needs to be communicated more clearly.  Which car park is for each room.  Always a difficult one.","Room was well presented and warm.

"Clean and simple family friendly accommodation, with waterpark a bonus","Beds weren't super comfortable - there was a dip in the middle of the double which was awkward. Kitchen was billed as self contained but we had one pot without a lid and a frypan with a loose handle. No oven, just a microwave/convection hybrid with no instruction manual which limited us a lot. Lack of proper changeroom for women at the waterpark was a bummer too (cubicle with a curtain was not the most comfortable or secure). Consider adding flyscreens in any future renovations - would be nice to enjoy the breeze without letting in the bugs (and there were lots of those!)","The cabins were nice and tidy and quiet, didn't hear a peep from any other guests so felt nice and secluded. The water park was fun despite the renovations - the four year old had the time of her life! Living space was a good size for us. Close enough to town centre to explore everything. Staff were very friendly and it was nice having a discount at the waterpark because of all the work. Complementary milk was a nice touch too.

"Comfortable, homey stay in chalet. :)","The kitchen items weren't super clean - lip marks on glasses and we rewashed everything we used. Lady at the spa reception the night we stayed was super rude - we got in before the cutoff (8pm) but she scolded us for being ""very late"" even though we were there before the last call and was generally very standoffish. Considering we paid $56 for 25 mins in the hot pool, she could've been a bit nicer.","Beds were comfy, chalet was spacious and warm. Bathroom had heated floor!

Amazing place for a family getaway,More so feedback: We ordered takeout and needed more rubbish space (only a small bin in the family sized unit). Luckily we always carry rubbish bags when travelling so it wasn't left out before we departed.,"The welcome I was met with at Reception was awesome!

Lovely,"I was inadvertently given a key for the wrong room. I did realise some hours later when I noticed the bedding configuration was different to what I'd booked. Luckily, this was just before the other guests had checked into the room as it would have been awkward if they'd come in when I was in the room, or worse if I'd been out if when they arrived to find all of my personal items in the space! The other negative is that the conjoined rooms are very noisy - I could hear EVERYTHING from the adjacent guests (talking, arguing, hocking, thumping about and the child jumping off the bunk). 

Also, the pool area could do with some a refresh - some deep cleaning/maintenance/refurbishment as there were areas where the paint was coming off, lots of weeds etc. One of the waterslides was closed off. The private pools are somewhat creepy and not at all what I expected. They're dark and dingy, and all I could hear was conversations from the family next to me so I didn't spend long in there at all.","I had a great stay at Debretts. All of the staff across the facility were amazing. Welcoming, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. My visit included accommodation plus use of the pool and a spa treatment, it was all very nice. I used the pools, visited the spa in the morning when it was quieter, then my room was ready so I checked in. After exploring the town and having a meal I came back to the pools again in the evening. 

I booked one of the cheaper rooms with shared facilities, as it was just a short 1-night stay so I didn't mind not having a private bathroom too much. I can't comment much on the shared kitchen/lounge as I didn't use but the bathrooms were fine.

Great for a family stay,"Bathroom was surprisingly unclean, considering the condition of the rest of the chalet was really pretty good. Scum around the tap was easily wiped with toilet paper - obvious it had not been cleaned between guests. The hair dryer did not work either which was disappointing.  A chopping board in the kitchenette would be a great addition.","Loved the space of the chalet. Lots of room, and enough space to not be right on top of each other.  Perfect for our family.  Beds warm and cosy.  The staff were so friendly and helpful.  Pools were awesome, even though on the last morning one of the main pools only had about 1/2 a foot of water in...kids still splashed around.

"Amazing, lots of things to do and great for the kids!!",I wonder what the construction work was for the hot pools. I'll be back to see the finish product. The room gets quite messy and sometimes I don't like to leave it for the cleaners. Is there a broom or vaccum in the rooms?

Run down & tired resort,"We received a guest discount for use of the swimming area, however upon arrival we were informed that there was construction work ongoing and half the pools were closed. Guests not staying in the hotel were offered a discount to recognise this, however as guests of the hotel, we were told that as we already had been provided with a normal guest discount, we would be given no further discount to recognise the construction works. This felt completely unfair. Upon entering the pool area, we found it to be disgusting. Stains, dirt and moss everywhere. There was a dirty wet carpet between the natural pool and another pool that appeared mouldy and had moss growing on it. Honestly one of the worst spa pools we have ever been to - it was foul and in serious need of an upgrade. We felt ripped off completely.

Not really an ideal place to stay with younger kids.,"The lighting outside shining into the room was horrible. It was a constant bluish, green light lighting up the whole apartment all night. The curtains did nothing to keep the light out. Not good if you have children or if you like to sleep in the dark... That alone puts me off staying there again.

The heat pumps heat only reached the rooms if you kept the bedroom doors open and had it turned up to the max. Again not ideal for families who need children to go to sleep before the adults and also not ideal privacy. Also the room closest to the heat pump got really hot if you wanted to heat the far room. 

The whole bathroom floor flooding everytime you have a shower as its not a closed in shower. You can't go toilet without wet feet. Children's pants get wet when they want to go toilet. Nothing to wipe excess water away.

That was fine. We checked out of 1 room by 10am after the first night and asked if it was possible to check in earlier to the next room seeing as we were already there. They said they would try, and they would text me when the room was ready for us. No text - and at 14.10pm (check in was at 14.00) I went to reception to ask if the room was ready, only to be told 'Yes, its been ready for a while'.

Shortly after checking in, we found a cockroach in my children's room, which was quite unsettling. Additionally, we were surprised by a $150 surcharge for having seven people in our party, a fee that was not communicated beforehand.

We spoke to the receptionist when it opened at 8 am and she was able to give us both codes - one for the morning and one for the afternoon.

- The large master bedroom window blinds opened directly to expose you to your neighbors (aka no privacy!)

- Bedding for five, but dining seating only for four. We had to bring a chair from outside in and then cozy around the table
- Hadn’t realized it would cost us $14pp each day just to use the pool
- Given an ‘accessible’ room (certainly didn’t request nor need it) - there was no counter space in bathroom. I’m sure others that do need an accessible room would appreciate somewhere to leave their toiletries too.","Pros:

Wouldn’t recommend really :/,"Rooms were soo overpriced for what we actually got. Booked 4 rooms 1 out of the 4 got towels replaced despite going to the reception and asking if rooms could have clean towels and bedding. Went back towels not replaced dirty towels still left and bed made without changing sheets. Milk is given, almost forgot when u check in when they should be in rooms already. The next day you don’t get topped up another milk but coffee and sugar sachets are replaced only (not the hot choc for the kids :/ ) These small things add up and was just irritating :/ receptionist also gave wrong information or didn’t explain herself properly l, asked about the Māori rock carving and she tells me “it’s an hour drive out and an hour drive back from there” that put us off going as wasn’t keen for that “drive out” turns out she meant the boat ride out to get to the rock takes an hour and another hour to get back…so annoying. The paperwork that had been printed out and ready for us at reception were pretty much all wrong..the lady there explained it’s fine just list the people staying in each room…when given the keys to the rooms it was so confusing the lady didn’t really know which room had how many beds so it was like a guessing game, again so annoying",The two cleaner girls were really nice. when asked nicely if they could replace bedding and towels they did so and responded nicely.,2.0,April 2022,"April 3, 2022",Quadruple Room with Shared Bathroom,2,Family,8.3,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0005449807230245642

PLEASE clean the kitchen properly!,"The cleanliness of the kitchen frankly was a shock. Dust on top of the fridge thick enough so a previous guest had written into it. Bits of food inside and outside the fridge with food not cleaned but just smeared around. This may not be so easily visible on the photos but was very noticeable in person. Dust and hair visible in a gap under the kitchen cabinet. When I drew the curtains there were two large stains visible on it.

Three of the four staff we interacted with were unfriendly and grumpy and we felt we inconvenienced them. For example, when my wife ordered a meat pie the lady behind the counter just turned and walked away. We looked at each other puzzled. A while back this lady came with a paper bag and handed it to my wife without words – there was a meat pie in it she had heated up. Now people can have a bad day, but as said, three of the four staff we interacted with were behaving like this.

Considering we paid $300 for one night we are very disappointed. We stayed at backpackers at a fraction of this price which were cleaner, the staff was friendly and bending over backwards to help.

What I write here is a fair description of our experience.","We booked this accommodation because it's walking distance to the thermal pools.

"Unfortunately, poor value for spend. OK experience, not likely to return.","Accommodation - Daily service was below average, each day, vacuum was hopeless, more investment required for real equipment to pick up and clean the floors effectively. Investment in better dishwasher needed. Parts of the bathroom walls were not clean, had previous guests hair etc. and no toilet cleaning products. If you're staying in a Motel for longer than 3 days you should have had the bathroom serviced and the bins emptied. We stayed for 6 nights. The cleaners were lovely, but less than 5mins each time for servicing.  When departing, Reception staff seemed to busy to care when they asked how was our stay and I said it was ""OK"", they didn't care to find out more, nor looked me in the eye, instead said thank you, goodbye.

Pool - Other behaviour went unnoticed by others and it was kind of hard to identify 'pool guards' so would recommend a change in 'tops' for obvious sakes. Unfortunately only one slide was operating which was very disappointing for our son, there were other works going on and 'cautioned taped off' and the deck under the outdoor carpet seemed well overdue for repair as it bounced when you walked along it. New Years Eve the pool closed an hour earlier, however many of us that went there at 8.30pm expecting at least an hour to spa, were disappointed as we arrived and it was closing, not advertised well anywhere and was a waste of our '3 day pass' we purchased.","Accommodation - Friendly, welcoming staff when we checked in.

Nice enough,"Spider webs up high, and a lot of dust on fridge and microwave shelf. I only see it because I'm quite tall though. Mostly clean, and staff were friendly.
 Was expecting a lake view, but could only see a very tiny piece of the lake, so I guess there is a lake view??.

Honest review,"I believe people will be happy with this room if they don't have other members staying in other rooms comparing with each other and prices paid. I was disappointed in my room in comparison to other rooms and I didn't think that I had good value for the price I paid. I do think the price and advertising of this room needs to be revised as more dissatisfaction will continue. The shower was a perfect size for families with wee ones but the overall size of the bathroom was ridiculous for a family advertised room, again in comparison to other options that were cheaper with bigger bathrooms. Also advertised is a lake view which is barely visible. Electric blankets which weren't there, not an issue due to heat pump but it is advertised. Also advert says refrigerator so I was expecting a full sized refrigerator when arriving I had to borrow space in another members refrigerator as my room only had a bar fridge. The bin was also on the small size for a family room but bins were close enough to empty. I believe the other rooms were great value for the price but my room was overpriced in comparison, I personally felt that the cheaper rooms next to our one had many better features and the more expensive rooms weren't that much more expensive, if I knew I would have paid the extra for these rooms as they were a great great deal better and not much more darer. And lastly, one staff member was horrible but thankfully considering how kind the rest of the staff were, it is no hassle to overlook this one person.","The atmosphere was nice and relaxing. The heat pump was necessary and a great option and our beds were comfortable. Park for kids is great and communal area is a great place to chat and have coffee. Access to pools is great.

Beautiful will 100% be back,Didn't like that the details of the renos and restrictions on slides were not brought to my attention until after I paid. Tbh i would have still stayed and paid it just seemed a lil dishonest although we loved the place and will 100% look to rebook in the future. Staff were exceptionally friendly especially the pool staff a+++ service.  To use the pools you need to pay an extra $14 per adult per day. They have a family pass $90 for 3 days 2 kids 2 adults.  It maybe on booking.com but i didn't see the additional charge. I would have paid it anyway as the pools were one of the reasons I booked for the kids.,Place is so beautiful. Great location. We had superior family room - it was very comfortable. The pools were in renovation when we stayed and will be amazing when finished. The pools both thermal heated and chlorine cold were nice although with the renovations they really should come part of ticket. On booking.com the photos show the pools as if they are part of a package when they are not. Absolutely loved the place and will 100% try and come back.

Superb stay for a relaxing retreat for a family with a young child.,"We missed towel service on one day. Wasn't a major, but more regular towel service would be ideal for a spa resort. We were told we could have gone to reception to swap out the pool towels, so not a major. We also happened to have brought our own towels for the pool which was a great idea. I didn't like the fry pans for cooking eggs/bacon, but hey... that's something that is easily worn out and what they had did the trick. That said, I'm very picky on my fry pans and I'm happy to bring my own and we'll definitely be back next time.","This was an amazing retreat to relax as a family of 3, 2 adults and a 4 year old. I was worried about travelling with a young child, but this place made it easy. The one bedroom apartment floor space was huge and we set up a little play area in the living room. The beds and couch were very comfy. The kitchen/fridge was large with ample space to prep breakfasts/lunch/basic dinner. I loved the closets were set up to store suitcases flat so you can open them up like a drawer and access your things without your stuff in the way. Heaps of bathroom drawer storage to keep sink area clutter free, we were able to keep a whole pack of nappies in the bottom drawer for night time. The aesthetic of the gardens and surrounding area was amazing. The closeness to the spa pools, discount on spa pool (yes, you do have to pay for them, but the discount is good and I'd rather pay for them separately than have it added to the room charge daily then you can choose to go or not), but we went multiple times a day for two days, it was amazing. You get a return pass for free re-entry on the same day and the lighting at night on the walk back from the hot pools was excellent. Overall, a relaxing place, great for families and close to everything.

Over priced and not up to Top10 holiday park standards.,"The kitchen had a tiny frying pan and a couple of saucepans. No large pans at all to go into the oven or to cook on the stove top. There wasn’t even a paring of chopping knife so we ended up eating out. 
The view from our motel unit was not good and was advertised with a lake or Mountain View but it overlooked a road and the tiniest glimpse of mountain through trees.
Parking was really awkward in our unit (motel number 5) and had to reverse out through a tight windy area around other vehicles which was frustrating.
The light in the bedroom flickered, and the TV had no guide, clunky controls and was poor quality.
There was no artwork or any decoration in the unit, it seemed to be all done on the cheap. The bedroom had no heat pump just an electric heater which was ok but could have been better for the price.

Overpriced with health hazards.,"Where do I start? There was black mould on the roller blind and algue growing on the bathroom trap, and a big layer of dust on the carpet edging. The mattress on the queen bed was super uncomfortable for two people (both of them average-sized with 1.7m and 70kg). The mattresses in the bunkroom were foam only, which might be okay for kids but was a painful experience for us adults. It felt like we were sleeping straight on the slates. This room should never be rentable by a group of adults at least not without a warning about the mattress type. The kitchen is poorly equipped and the crockery was dirty. We had to wash everything before we could use it. There were three coat hangers for 4 people. We had to ask twice for tea towels, a dish cloth, towels, and toilet paper of which we were given one roll only. There was no storage space or shelving in the bathroom only a wee stool. You could hear the neighbours' TV or talking through the thin walls. And all that for 250 dollars a night! When I showed reception the photos of the mould and algue (health hazards as I told her) on checkout, I got a sweet smile and apology. Not blaming the young receptionist here, it's not her fault but maybe she should be trained to call her manager in situations like that.

I thought at least we could have maybe checked out an hour or so later which would have been very useful to us. Most hotels in my experience let you check out a little later. Also on the first night my daughter got locked in the toilet, we had to ring after hours service to get some help, the guy arrived with no tools, not sure how he expected to fix a lock without tools, so he had to go get some, then when he came back my daughter had managed to get it unlocked but we did not trust it and didn't use the lock after that. She was stuck in there for 30 mins. Also expected to have some paper towels and maybe salt & pepper in the kitchen extremely basic stuff provided and the stove top was dirty so were a lot of the glasses.",The location was great and the staff were friendly.,5.0,October 2023,"November 1, 2023",Deluxe Lodge,2,Family,8.3,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0003826802843666996

Our holiday,"I booked x1 cabin for my family, then received an e-mail from De Bretts notifying me it was two shared-cabins. That was okay, however upon arrival I was told the cabins were entirely separate, at opposite ends of the holiday-park. This was inconvenient as my children were split into two ""groups"", our belongings of food etc were shared between two cabins instead of one - causing a great deal of to-and-fro walking in-between each cabin. This caused the kids' bedtimes & breakfasts tricky between two cabins placed far from each other. The smaller cabin had paper-thin walls - we could hear the couple next door snoring amongst other things! 

Both cabins were exceptionally clean as were the bathroom facilities. The smaller cabin didn't have a microwave or sink so I couldn't do the dishes.

"Comfortable, but not much else -- Pool Access is extra $$","We didn't like that you have to pay 14$ per person to enter the mineral pool. When we booked, it was indicated that 'most packages' have pool access included, which yes, is vague wording but we figured it would be or if not, that it would be a minimal charge. We can see now that the wording on both Booking and Taupo Debretts website is updated, which helps out future guests, but it still doesn't tell you how much. Totally could have been an oversight on our part, but definitely something that affected our satisfaction with the stay. Especially since the mineral pools are under construction and while the pool that is open is nice, again, it doesn't feel worth the money. 

As for the apartment; it's comfortable, but nothing special, and not what you would expect for the price. Overall, it feels like everything needs a bit of a touch up",,5.0,March 2024,"March 16, 2024",One-Bedroom Apartment,4,Couple,8.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.636334040590618e-05
