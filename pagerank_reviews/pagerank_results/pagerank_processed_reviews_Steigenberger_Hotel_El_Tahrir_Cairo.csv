Well-located hotel still with room for improvement,"- Smell of smoke, even though it was a non-smoking room, probably the ventilation/AC-system is not tight
- Unnecessary disturbance to the room e.g. for massage, check-out etc. - maybe that‘s an Egyptian thing, but for Europeans this is very strange. The guest don‘t want to be unnecessarily disturbed.
- Environment a bit run down, even though the Steigenberger may be one of the best hotels compared to the average, lousy and substandard Cairo hotels.","+ Centrally located

If your rooms are close to it, you will hear it.","The hotel is very good and the location is excellent. Very close to everything as shops, malls, restaurants and historical attractions. Staff is very friendly and helpful. A little bit busy but it is ok. The hotel has a special person/desk for transportation and the payment is done through hotel reception. Excellent breakfast, with special bars for orders. Many types of food, fruits, bread, sweets etc. I believe it will be impossible to not satisfy majority of tastes. Rooms are small but enough to move inside. Special place for luggage, closes with hangers, slippers etc. Bathroom is nice and all toiletries you need. Daily cleaning a replenishment of bar. No balconies and not open windows. It is normally for hot places (same Dubai). Centralized AC and not noisy. Dinner in the restaurant is very good. Not a lot of choices but what they provide is very delicious. Restaurant staff is good and the dish is served really fast. It is a 4* hotel so do not expect low prices. Also the quality of services is 4*. Alcohol is served in the restaurant and bar. There are enough choices. They have live music in the lobby bar (very nice and good singer) and on the outside terrace bar. When we stay there was Egyptian Music. It is very nice to listen and to dive into their music. The terrace bar is not bad but definitely poorer than the inside bar. The hotel is out of main boulevard so, the noise from street is not very loud but there is. I remarked the cleaning personnel who is very polite/ professional and the doorman who is a big man but excellent behavior, very polite and supportive. Also reception staff was great. They try to solve the check-in/out very fast and other problems. We book a taxi via hotel which was nice and safe. I think they have their own taxis. Excellent services and drivers. We booked it 2 ways, I mean from hotel to Cairo Tower and back.

Food at the hotel is vey affordable and breakfast is excellent with a lot of variety. Staff arranged an excellent goodbye gift for us with fruits, dates and Arabic desserts. 

Location is in the centre of Tahrir Square so except noise (no blame on hotel, it’s just the location). Traffic can be quite horrendous at time.

Good safe stay in Tahrir Square,No views for this category of rooms. The room keys worked infrequently which made us return to the reception multiple times for reactivation. The worst thing was this manager who took my phone on the last day of my stay to tell me about Booking.com genius account but had gone ahead and given the hotel a 10 star rating and a comment 'Exceptional' without my knowledge. I came to know about this when I received an email from booking.com that my review has been approved. That was unethical and a gross invasion of the privacy of a guest. Now I understand now how they have a 9 star rating for a property that should be around 8. So please ignore such ratings from other reviews.,The location and security at the hotel were great.

Excellent hotel in central Cairo,No complains.,"Very nice hotel, clean, comfortable and excellent location. 
We had a minor issue with a floor lamp which was dealt with super quickly, but that was not enough: We were offered an upgrade as well. Not necessary, but of course appreciated. 
The new room was closer to the street however, and we had issues sleeping as traffic in Cairo is... Well, louder than what we are used to. 
I asked if it was at all possible to move us again (and would have been perfectly fine with returning to the room we previously had, upgrade or not!) - and not only was my request granted, but we actually received yet another upgrade, to a suite in a quiet area.

And as if this was not enough, we even had a very kind surprise waiting for us in the room (beautiful rose petals on the bed and in a bubble bath, it was our honeymoon).

Amazing service, absolutely above and beyond expectations. 

A big thank you to the Assistant Front Office Manager, Mr. Mahmoud Hamza, who was incredibly kind, thoughtful and accommodating. The whole staff also deserve a compliment.

Exceptional Staff,,"This review is for the day I checked out. 
Hotel checkout is often the last interaction that guests have with the hotel staff and it is important to leave a lasting positive impression.

Firstly, when I called the reception for assistance, the bellboy arrived promptly, ensuring that my needs were met in a timely manner. 

Secondly, as per my request, I was allowed to keep my room card as a souvenir. This is rare and it’d be great if more hotels provided such option. Especially for people like me who loves to collect such cards. 

Lastly, I was pleasantly surprised when Mr. Mahmoud Hamza, Assistant Front Office Manager at the hotel, offered me a complementary limo ride to the airport. This gesture went above and beyond my expectations and made my departure from the hotel a truly memorable experience.

In conclusion, the service provided during my hotel checkout was exceptional and made me feel genuinely loved as a guest.
The personalized attention, genuine interest, and sincere farewell were all aspects that stood out and made me feel like my satisfaction truly mattered.

Best 4-star experience and value for money.,"Just the wifi download speed, but, thats across all areas in Cairo. May be the telecom provider issue.","Experience:
Ok let me be honest. This hotel should be the role model for all other 4 star hotels in the world. The experience you get here is equal to that of 5-stars. Right from the security to reception to housekeeping to dining - All are perfect. My special compliment to Farida, Marina and Mahmoud for providing exceptional guest service during my stay. My stay here was for 5 night, but, I extended to another 6 nights.

Dining and Breakfast: 
The breakfast is super. Wide selection and very attentive staff. In other hotel, when the staff barely attend your table to offer a coffee or any other service, this hotel staff simply make sure you feel like home and pampered to max. 

Location
Close to el tharir square, and just 200m from the bustling market where you name it and you find it. A heaven for someone who wants to shop, dine, walk and experience.

Transportation:
Easily available to and fro to hotel. Nile Corniche is just a 10-min waking distance. But you need some road crossing skills as the traffic might be dodgy.

Parking:
The hotel has parking space available underground. Didnt try but good for people who wish to drive and park their vehicle.

Rooms:
Rooms are small, but, clean. The houskeeping staff are really attentive and address to all your immediate needs. Good for couple who need best experience and value-for-money stay.

Bar:

The street noise level in the rooms - we all know Cairo is loud, the constant car honking and buzz etc., however, for a hotel in the 4 star league, and with such a reputation and price tag, to not have good soundproofing, is a fairly big no-no.  
One can barely sleep 3-4 hours per night because of this. (I live in a noisy city that never sleeps, thus I’m not super sensitive.)","The location is perfect. The staff is very professional, accommodating and do their best to make sure you have a great stay. 

I cannot comment on the breakfast, bar, restaurant facilities because I didn’t get a chance to try them. They have a spa, I absolutely recommend getting a massage, especially if it’s before taking your flight home.

First time with Steingenberger,"There are room for improvement to power up your hotel standard. People said that the rooms are small which is understandable for downtown location. Our thoughts are that you can play with the use of the room, such as larger the side of bedside shelves. We like to put book, glasses, phone and glass of water next to our bed. 2-seater sofa instead of one, so 2 guests can sit together, watching TV or having snack together. The hotel might originally be for a business stay for 1 person but look around at breakfast, there are a lot of couples.

Central location but not worth the premium over other options,"It was not special for the price and was crowded with noisy bus tours.  We paid for the upgraded Nile view room, which may have been worth it to get the higher floor (assuming lower floors were nosier), but was not worth it for the ""fruit basket"" (three apples) or the view (city view with some Nile, but not particularly worth looking at).  We've stayed in central downtown hotels around the world that offered a more spectacular experience and were somewhat disappointed overall.  The room was noisy because the area around the hotel is very busy, and we were able to sleep with the white noise machines on our phones. The pool is on the 2nd floor and is so loud with all the honking from the traffic that we found it unpleasant.  The food in the restaurant was tasty but the service at breakfast (service at dinner was fine) managed to be both annoyingly obsequious and inattentive at the same time. [Pro tip: if you are tired of waiting for a breakfast server to fill your coffee cup, just try to go to the coffee station and fill it yourself--you'll be chastised, but they'll bring you coffee.  Also, ask for espresso, cappuccino or latte instead of a ""coffee""--their plain coffee is awful.]  Overall, we will not be returning.

Ask about the programs that the guest previously booked and inform if is a good idea or not. Check the reputations of some tour guides. This will be a plus for sure.

Wonderful,"Rooms are noisy, both from the traffic outside, and the thin walls separating the rooms (you can ear people speaking in the rooms next to yours). I always slept with ear plugs.
The wifi login didn't work, every day I had to ask a receptionist to enter the code for me, because my combination room+name was not working. This for the entire period I was there (4 days), despite knowing the root cause, it was never fixed. It was annoying. 
You cannot sent postcards from the hotel, even if with the stamps.

hotel is good (especially value for money) but suffers from being in Cairo,"Cairo is noisy, dirty and really, really oppressive (this from a Londoner) so the hotel suffered from being in Cairo! for example:
-lounging by the pool is noisy; the car horns are ridiculous and consequently the background music is turned right up. really horrible.
-it’s also dirty - it’s pollution in the air (cars, dust and sand) and nothing to do with the hotel except its location. however, it IS really bad. if you are asthmatic, make sure you have spare inhalers!
-We went to the Pool Bar one afternoon (3pm?) and they were out of beer and none appeared for the rest of the day. The next day, they managed to locate some. BUT we had to go and request it and wait. We are not hopeless lushes! we had been touring the sites all day and just wanted to chill with a beer before dinner.
-no clocks, even on the room tv. really weird that there are no (zero!) clocks anywhere so you have to have your own
-restaurent food isn’t very Egyptian. honestly, why go to Egypt and eat European?
- the traffic in the near area is BONKERS. Crossing the road is seriously scary. makes getting around really hard or you take cabs everywhere (though they are really cheap).","staff were universally pleasant and helpful.

Overall the hotel was a 10/10. The staff was very welcoming and addressed all concerns.,"The only complaint was the size of the pool (however, I saw the pictures online so I was expecting it.)  I suggest going to the pool before 4:30pm if you want to actually enjoy swimming around. It gets very crowded later in the day.","I took my children and 2 of their friends for my son's 30th Birthday. I informed the hotel of his birthday before arrival and they placed a complimentary cake in his room on his actual birthday. I wanted a hotel in a walkable area and this hotel did not disappoint. We were literally across the street from the Egyptian Museum so no need to book with a tour company. We felt safe in the area as we were out walking around with the locals every night until 2-3am. They have security outside to ensure that only guests of the hotel or arranged transportation enters the property. 

The food at the hotel was very good and affordable and they had many options to choose from. I ordered room service at least once a day because of my busy days/late nights I didn't have the energy to go down to the restaurant; they always called to make sure our food was satisfactory and if not they would correct/remake it.

He was really helpful and funny and we had a really smooth check in with him.

"Very comfortable and convenient, with excellent, helpful staff; not perfect, but nowhere is.","The only complaints I have are about the actual design of the room, which the staff and ownership really have no say over. One, there are NO fans in the bathrooms, which means a hot shower fogs up the space and the mirror and simply floods out into the rest of the room once the door is open. Two, nearly all the lights in the room are on one switch and cannot be turned off separately; this includes the lights for the concessions space, which were really bright and faced directly into the beds area.

These are all fairly minor complaints that are basically infrastructure issues with whomever designed the hotel. So, they were annoying but manageable.","Room was clean, quiet, comfortable. Plenty of storage space even for two people. We had basically twin beds but they were comfortable and didn't feel too small. Hotel is very well-placed in the city and access to taxis, Uber, and local restaurants and shops was easy.

"Excellent location and great service, but our stay was negatively impacted by various issues, especially secondhand smok","Our major issue was that despite having a room on a non-smoking floor and smoking being banned on elevators, the hallway, elevators, and bar area reeked of tobacco smoke and made us feel sick. A few other minor issues - the hairdryer could not be used above level 1 due to limited power, the hotel provides a 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner instead of separate shampoo and conditioner, and our room felt overly musty/humid due to poor ventilation in the bedroom and no ventilation in the bathroom. Additionally, frequent use of the gym restroom by male staff made gym use slightly uncomfortable for female guest.","Wonderful, helpful staff and service.

Wonderful,"Our stay at the Steigenberger Hotel in Cairo was largely enjoyable, offering a serene and comfortable retreat in the bustling city. The rooms and service were impressive, and the overall atmosphere was very welcoming.

We did notice a couple of areas for improvement. There was a moment of confusion when our tour was due to pick us up, where the interaction with the security staff seemed a bit unclear. Also, on our departure day, despite having settled our bill, a staff member at the door briefly inquired about payment. While these were minor misunderstandings, they highlight an opportunity for enhanced communication and procedural clarity within the hotel team.

These small points aside, we found the Steigenberger to be a great choice in Cairo for its quality service and tranquil ambiance. We would still recommend it for a comfortable and pleasant stay.","Our stay at the Steigenberger Hotel in Cairo was a delightful experience, offering a serene oasis amidst the bustling city. The hotel provided excellent service, comfortable accommodations, and a sense of tranquility that was much appreciated. Its location is ideal for exploring Cairo, yet it offers a peaceful retreat from the city's noise and pace. We strongly advise those considering a trip to Cairo to consider investing a bit more in their accommodation, as it can make a significant difference in comfort and overall experience. Based on our encounters with other hotels in the area, the Steigenberger Hotel stands out for maintaining high standards and ensuring a pleasant stay.

"Had expected a lot more, therefore very disappointed","1) We were in room 8020 and the bed was poor. The mattress was clearly old and the bed cracked whenever you moved. 
2) Even though the window glass was relatively thick, it didn't block the sound of the streets and you could hear people honking the horns of the car (one of the national sports in Egypt) all day long. And it was quite loud ... 
3) We were very tired - stayed 1 night only - and decided to have dinner at the restaurant. Bad choice. It took them about an hour to prepare dinner and the meal was overcooked and far from tasty. And this for Western European pricing ... so avoid the à la carte restaurant if you can. Go out. There's plenty to do / eat locally.","The staff were friendly and accommodating.

I stayed there twice in the same week.On my second time, I arrived Cairo early, couple of hours before the waiting time and I was planning to leave my luggage with them and come back right at the checking time,instead they made the room ready and asked us to freshen up which was very very lovely of them :)

A great and comfortable place to stay in Cairo - with a breakfast buffet like from a dream,"Though the windows should have been sound-proof, the sound made it somehow through between the window and the wall (or window frame). At times so much noise went inside that it seemed like the window is open - although we were in one of the higher levels of the building. There have been many reports like this about almost all hotels in Cairo. So it seems to be a major issue. Ear plugs are a must.","From the moment of entering the hotel you felt an international and warm flair. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and had the Western European standards that I am used to - opposites to two other hotels where I stayed on my trip. The mini bar is filled rich with drinks and snacks, bravo. When leaving I was told the soft drinks even were for free. The prices for the other food of the minibar were reasonable. The hotel has a 24 hours restaurant. The service in the evening was a little slow, but the food was great. The breakfast ... was ... a dream! I have never seen such a breakfast in a normal city-hotel. They had simply everything! Everything! Oh, and in the evening they had a singer in the lobby, that was a surprise.

Bad Value for Money Option,"Room
Even though our reservation was for a Queen bed room, we were offered a 2 single beds which was disappointing. Room was too small for what we paid for, and too noisy (seemed that the windows were not sound proof). Room decor could use an uplift.

Dinner
We had dinner at the restaurant twice, and 2 completely different experiences. The a la carte dinner was good and fair, with reasonable Egyptian food (very short wine list though). The buffet experience was astonishingly terrible, food had very low quality and we had people in our group that were sick after it.

Value for Money
Definitely the worse topic. It is a very expensive hotel for what it has to offer compared to close competitors such as Sofitel and Intercontinental. For the very high price you pay (mainly due to location, which is arguably bad given it’s impossible to walk to any destination in Cairo), quality x price is very bad. 

Drinks
For international tourists it’s important to know that the hotel charges an absurdly high amount for a simple cocktail - a gin and tonic costs nearly £20 pounds!!!","Room
Overall the Superior Queen room was regular. Bathroom was good and clean (great shower), comfortable bed and high  quality linen sheets. The fact it had an iron plank helped a lot.

Breakfast

A stay as expected for a connoisseur of this city,"Noise can be annoying in some rooms and floors of the hotel but we know that Cairo is a very noisy city.
The rooms acces cards are easily demagnetized even if we were careful not to keep it near the mobile but we had to go to the reception often.
In our opinion, the water in the bottles received in the rooms tasted like mud; but fortunately the water you can buy it at the bar is much better (another brand).
Otherwise only small incidents that will become funny memories over time ...","The hotel was clean and very conveniently located in Tahrir square, very close to the older Egyptian Museum.  An ATM machine is in the lobby. 
We spent a week here so our experience with breakfast depended on the day, in some better, in some not so good. The most complicated thing was to get an espresso or a cappuccino ...

We noticed it seconds before an employee was about to load the luggage in a taxi which was not ours (…).

For this price I do not recommend,"The hotel is geared towards tour groups and this excludes the individual tourist.
Hence the queues for breakfast every day - no free tables like in a canteen, not in a 4* hotel for the price of USD 262 per night.

Not my favourite hotel,"The changing temperature of the water in the shower is unpleasant.
Curtains are not clean, the carpet is brushed instead of cleaned.
Fridge is not powerful.
The elevator which requires the use of the key is annoying, and I am not the only one who was annoyed about this, in fact every time I used it someone if not all those inside were somewhat annoyed by this. There is a box of tissues inside the elevator with a dust bin under it. 
I did not use the pool.","This is a box hotel, no possibilities to eat outside. Nice entrance as is usually the case in those hotels, there is a small souvenir shop. The staff is very helpful.  However i had to keep reminding them that having allergies to scented products I did not want scented products in my room.  They were nice about it, but I had to remind them on 3 occasions, I was staying with them 4 days. They apologized and send me some complementary apples. I had little pastries and apples on the first day. 
There is a bench for the suitcase, which is handy. A large armoire. Good size bathroom, not a lot of space for toiletry. Nice size shower, however the hot water changes temperature throughout your shower, not pleasant. 
The bed is very comfortable. Plugs on the bedside tables, reading lamps on both sides. A comfortable chair to sit on with a table next to it. The curtains are very dusty and could use a wash everywhere inside the hotel.  The window does not open, I do not like that. There is no real garden. Water is provided, lots of it.

Worst hotel stay ever,"First time in Cairo and the location of this hotel is great but... From check in, the staff looked grumpy. We had 4 nights in the hotel and F&B department was soooo poor.
The staff at breakfast service were dull and with little or no knowledge of the magic words.
Al carte menu is not as it reads. Ordered the Cairo meatballs(they were delicious), they were to be served with mushroom risotto but to be honest, I think we got rice pudding with no mushrooms. 
At the bar, Metwally was the only stuff who understood customer service and was very good at making cocktails. I ordered  mai Thai when Metwally wasn't at shift but got 3 different versions which were nothing close to what a mai Thai should be.
Farah, housekeeping, was amazing. You could see her smile even with her mask on. Her housekeeping skills are excellent. 
Lastly, would advise you to check and confirm your bill before you check out. We signed for a couple of bills and paid upon check out but unfortunately, a couple of days later, the hotel called us to say that they had not charged for some meals as they had been billed to another customer. 
This clearly showed that the staff did not pay attention at all as they provided the service. 
Wouldn't recommend rush to come back to this hotel nor recommend it to anyone.","Service from Metwally at the bar, we'll cleaned and tidy room from our warm, ever smiling housekeeper, Farah.",1.0,October 2021,"November 20, 2021",Junior Suite,4,Family,9.2,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0.00033972503716347404

Not Soundproofed Enough,"we paid for pool room but the hotel does not have sufficient soundproofing as advertised (the reason we chose this hotel). In Egypt they don’t respect that people maybe sleeping, and so beep their car horns until they get their way at all hours of the day and night which is not great for all those who are trying to sleep and so looking for a hotel that advertises soundproofing is a must. we had to downgrade our room to be able to go to a higher floor where we were offered no refund or compensation, until afterwards when I got an email for 15% off my next stay and even then on the second to top floor it made very little difference to the noise. we struggled to sleep for 4 nights and had to play white noise on our phones to try and help. it was a good hotel but we only wanted a quiet place to rest our heads while we spend 15 hours a day sightseeing Cairo, Giza and even to Alexandria and this hotel failed to deliver a quiet nights rest.","location is good, it’s in downtown, room was big enough and clean and a nice bathroom",4.0,May 2023,"May 21, 2023",Superior Pool View Room,3,Couple,9.2,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.00033415683696697235

The staff changed the them quickly with new ones but I am not sure if they had been washed either but was too tired to ask.

Way too expensive for what it has too offer and the staff needs better training,"- Rooms lack proper soundproofing. The hotel is located in a very noisy area but they ignored the problem, it's just too loud in the rooms.
- Staff in the restaurant is trying too hard. I don't need to be asked 4 times during a breakfast whether everything is alright, and 3 more times whether I want a coffee refill. I just want to eat in peace, not constantly answer questions with food still in my mouth!
- I was harrased by a staff member during check out to leave them a review on multiple websites.

Very Good,"Two things must be noted: the first is regarding the open spaces, which are very very limited to a small pool (where pidgeons are used to drink all the time). This will be a downside in comparison to other hotels that have gardens and more than one restaurant, as this reveals to be key in a city like Cairo. An open air restaurant, with the quality of food of this hotel, would for sure be a great add.
The second is about the insistence of the staff to leave a feedback. While in the room, I got called continuously to ask if everything was ok (not that bad of course). Less graceful was a, let’s say, “nudge” to leave a 5 star review on Google, in front of the staff employee while sitting in the swimming pool. I find this a very impolite attitude for a hotel of this level, which brought me, here, to lower my vote from 9 to 8.","It is a clean and pretty new building, rooms have plenty of space, bathrooms have very nice showers.

Perfect location and very accommodating,"The hotel does provide great hospitality. But we are humans, and mistakes do happen. Had a small misunderstanding/issue with my review for the stay. What amazed me is how gracefully Ms. Riham Khaled took responsibility of what happened, she apologised and fixed the issue. That is something what team players do. This situation should make the hotel realise what a gem of an employee Ms. Riham is. A team player like her deserve to be team lead/manager for setting an example to her subordinates. The hotel did take responsibility as well, not through words, but by their actions. Even though the issue was small, they offered to upgrade me to the best suite available and add complimentary breakfast for the rest of my stay, which I had to decline, thank you Mr. Ahmed El Sawy for understanding. Please note, I booked the cheapest room. The service, respect and warmth I got was so phenomenal that I did not feel like upgrading.

Fair,After staying at the Steigenberger in Luxor we expected more of the same of the room in Cairo. Unfortunately the room was small and noisy with no sound proof windows. It was difficult to communicate with some of the staff in English even when explaining to them in simple phrases. We didn't experience the service as personal and dedicated as you would expect from such a place. Furthermore the pillows were way to big and very uncomfortable. Overall just a lack of attention to detail.,"Breakfast was with a very impressive selection, even sushi. But we had better tasting falafel, omelet and coffee elsewhere.

The worst stay ever in Egypt.,"There is not enough space to describe this horrible place:

- The staff was not friendly at all, sometimes aggressive. 
   We booked a taxi to visit the pyramids, paid 10 times the amount of an Egyptian taxi, and we had to discuss during 1h30 min with the driver to finally arrive at the pyramids entrance. Before that, we were forced to visit the papyrus museum where we refused to buy anything and be forced to entry in a carriage renting center, that we also refused. It is to note that the horses at the carriage renting center were nearly all exhausted and hurt (we also saw some people hit the horses that refused to move). This should never happen and even more not with a five star hotel.  This is nothing more than stealing and kidnapped guest. Finally, the driver gave us some water but it was not mineral water but Egyptian distribution water, place in a bottle that has already been opened before, what a sabotage.

   We finally decide to leave the hotel in advance, booked a taxi and informed the staff that we quit earlier. They have phone us aggressively three times in one hour to be sure that we gonna make the check out..., ok but for room that we have paid in advance.

- Impossible to exchange euro in the hotel (in the device).

- Small room with nearly no soundproofing. The staff give us a communicating room while this not what we have book.
   The half of the towels where lacking in the room.

- The staff knock enter in the room while we were naked, not one time, not two time but three time in one hour !!!",Only the breakfast was good in this hotel.,1.0,September 2022,"September 13, 2022",Superior City View Room,3,Couple,9.2,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0.00023011900630234996

Great location but probably a bit over priced and bad food hygiene,"Dispite I asked for an itemised bill, the hotel was not able to provide a receipt with listing tax and service charge. Be aware there is 26% extra for your Booking.com bookings of any Egypt hotel. We were called to reception about our payment but it turned out we had paid the correct amount in the end. Breakfast was 17 USD per person, there were plenty of options and nice service but probably not worth the cost, especially my partner had upset stomach after having food in hotel. We didn't eat outside of the hotel during our two days of stay. Wifi keeps dropping out.

Great breakfast but very noisy outside,The hotel is just on a central square and it’s very very noisy as there is a traffic 24/7 and everyone is using signals.

TaxiCab Robbery,"Subject: Taxicab Robbery

Dear Steigenberger Management and to whom it may concern: 

I recently stayed at both your Pyramids and Tahir locations. While both were extremely comfortable and aesthetically pleasing, the Tahir location demonstrated a higher level of ethical responsibility.

During my stay at the Pyramids location, I needed a taxi to the Cairo airport. Following the advice of your staff, I used the taxi service located in the hotel lobby. They assured me of a reasonable price and legitimacy. However, en route to the airport, the driver pulled off to the side of the road and demanded an additional $40, claiming it was a new policy due to the new president. Feeling unsafe and anxious about missing my flight, I felt compelled to pay.

Later, I confirmed that this policy was a fabrication. Adding to my frustration, the driver had the audacity to ask for a tip after dropping me off far from the terminal entrance. On subsequent trips to the airport with different taxi services, I was dropped off directly in front of the terminal for a lower fare, which confirmed my suspicion of being deceived.

The $40 (1872 Egyptian pounds) may not be a large sum, but the manner in which it was extorted leaves me feeling extremely dissatisfied and with a bitter sense of mistrust. I had no such issues with taxis I booked through other means or at the Tahir location, indicating a significant problem with the personnel at the Pyramids location.

While I appreciate the upgraded room and the view of the pyramids from the pool area provided at the Pyramids location, it does not compensate for the distressing experience of being exploited in such a manner.

Sincerely,
Robbed at Steigenberger",,8.0,May 2024,"May 20, 2024",Superior City View Room,3,Couple,9.2,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0.00017144920134025754
Fair,"The hotel was not up to the standard considering the price per night. It also lacked open area both inside and outside.

Very good stay but windown isolation problem,Noise! Cairo is a noisy city. People like to communicate via honks while driving.

We were told at check-in that all drinks in the room fridge were free, but were charged at check-out and almost had a fight with the staff.
