Good,"Extremely slow check-in process. Burocratic, Unpleasant.
My room was next to the elevator, very noisy, I woke up the first day by the noise of other guests
Low quality breakfast, if feels like a cheap B&B than of a hotel.","Good location

Warning Warning Warning ⚠️ ⛔️  Do not stay in this hotel. The hotel was incredibly dirty and the food,"Warning Warning Warning ⚠️ ⛔️ 
Do not stay in this hotel. The hotel was incredibly dirty and the food was terrible. We requested a superior room and when we arrived we were greeted by an extremely small stuffy smelly dirty  room. There was no storage for our suitcases other than an open rack as you walked in the door. The air condition system was from something from 1980 blowing hot air into the room and not even a window to open. The hotel is in a terrible location, miles away from everything and we didn’t feel safe in the area. We travelled for a two week vaccination and specifically requested a swimming pool which was specified on their website as being open from may to September. We arrived to find out that it was closed for renovation. The first person said it would be open in a few days, then the waitress said 10 days and then finally receptionist said June. We requested after 5 mins of being there to have a room change. When they gave us the new room again you couldn’t swing a cat in. There was two tiny bed side tables and only one plug on one side of the bed. The bathroom
Was dirty and not what you would expect from this star rated hotel. We checked out after one day and the hotel charged us in full for the 10 days we were there. I requested hotel to refund us but they have ignored all emails and have also deleted this review which I feel guests should know about hotel. From start to finish this hotel was a complete disaster. Highly recommend staying near Plaka and also visit astir beach resort.","Warning Warning Warning ⚠️ ⛔️

Pretty decent.,"The room was a bit more rundown than I expected. It wasn't dirty, but the desk chair had discolourations. The bathroom ventilator was directly connected to the light and it was pretty loud. The most annoying thing was the TV that would turn itself on at 2h30 AM for no reason. I had to unplug it from the socket to make sure I wouldn't be randomly awaken by it.","The hotel was conveniently located and we were about 20/30 min away from all locations we needed to be at, including the airport.

Service is great but the prices are overestimated,"The pool was closed and it was not properly communicated. The bar was well-done and nicely refurbished but we expected some sort of a dresscode, not flipflops and shorts. The prices in the bar were over the roof.

Excellent city hotel to explore Athens,Paper cups in room and limited amenities in the room ie one tea bag each one coffee each and the smallest milks ever! Paper cups are so wasteful and not good for the environment.,Great location to get from Airport and into the city centre. Metro was easy to walk to if you wanted to alternatively we walked roughly 30/40 minutes to Parliament Square. Staff were very helpful. The roof top bar is great with it’s fabulous views.

This is a way to go if you want to enjoy that panoramic view of Athens. You will never forget it,Limited sunbeds are available at the rooftop pool so it is not easy to feel comfy there. The pool area is relatively small for that many guests. The window was a bit outdated in the room.,Helpful staff. Clean rooms. Excellent location. Rooftop bar is awesome.

"Well located hotel, modern and clean rooms, brace yourself with patience to be served though","Anything related to speed of servicing wasn’t amazing:
> Slow check-in process. Another guest before me decided to do an invoice process at a peak check-in time in the evening and the reception didn’t come up with an approach to handle the check-in process for those who were queuing up. Even though I had prepaid and just needed to get my key, I had to wait for 20’ till the invoice process of my predecessor was done, which is quite horrible when one is exhausted and checks in at a late evening time. It would have been so much better if I could check-in online or at a kiosk, especially since I prepaid. 
> The elevator system / capacity is probably small or not optimised for the size of the hotel. It took me 15’ of wait in order to get from the 10th floor to the lobby. I missed half of my breakfast time just waiting to get to the right floor, and when I got there I was told I couldn’t get my carry-on suitcase at the restaurant. Not a friendly experience when one has to wast 30’ in elevators and tries to save time.
> It’s the hotel’s decision to do that, but, considering the quality of service that I described above, charging for the usage of the gym facilities was a surprise.","> Good location close to the Airport metro line. Other than than that, it’s not particularly close to key attractions, but they’re close enough on metro, trolley, bus, or on foot for those who are more fit and like their long walk. 
> The single room was practical and spacious enough for a solo traveler, clean and well ventilated.
> The room offered good air conditioning (important for Athens).
> The staff are polite and helpful.",7.0,September 2022,"September 18, 2022",Classic Single Room,1,Solo traveler,8.1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0.0013466463113861562

It’s a good hotel but not nessarary worth the money,"1) The pool area is small and has limited business hours , not to mention that the hotel charges for a bed around the pool, and they only have something like 10 beds. It’s 10  Euro for a bed for 4 hours. Either 10:00 to 14:00 or 14:00 to 19;00. This was very unexpected !!!!
To get a bed you need to reserve in  advance at least the day before or stay in the queue in the entrance , at least 15 mins before it opens!


2) The blue line of the metro is 10 mins walking distance from the hotel but in summer time  even in early June , 10 mins are like 30 mins,,,, You need to keep in mind the blue line does not get to the Olyimpic stadium and u need to switch to the green line if u plan to get to the olyimpic stadium for a show.  


3) it’s pretty far from the main squares by foot ;","Breakfast was ok ( eggs,  only tomatoes and cucumbers , a few types of bread and cheese, etc. don’t expect good capochino ); note-  they don’t have too many options for vegan people 

The hotel is clean
Pretty big rooms considering it is in the city .  

A few bus lines run from the hotel to the city and to the stadium. Keep in mind most of them do not turn on air conditioning even in the summer time …

The staff in the hotel is  nice and polite and agreed to allow late check out with no extra charge . 

There are a few good restaurants around the hotel. One just across the street  The name is Spitiko Fagito, home style dishes , very good food and cheap. The are open  Mon~Fri from noon to 17;00 . Pay attention to the design and decoration inside . Added some photos ….
Another really good restaurant , but more expensive,  is a 1 min from the Anafiotika metro station . It’s calls Joann’s restaurant. Check the reviews in  trip advisors and you won’t be disappointed! The dishes are big , and can be shared. Very good verity of options, including for veggies .


There is also a big supermarket 5 mins away from the hotel 

When we stayed there before the Codeplay show, the hotel was fully booked and yet you didn’t feel it was too crowded .

Excellent,"Whilst paying to stay at the hotel one needed to pay for the deckchairs by the pool at a cost of 10€ per sun-bed. Then again, if renting the sun-beds they had no umbrella and were exposed to the sun all day. If a sun-bed is not rented there is the possibility to stay sitting down on tables.",Very clean.

Fair,"The hotel is quite gloomy. Pitch black and small elevators created this environment as well. The rooms are not very well designed, and have no windows that actually open. The shower is badly designed with no door so the water goes out all over the floor, and no shelf in the shower for soap or shampoo. 
Breakfast is very average. We asked at reception for more toilet paper, it never arrived. We asked for an iron, it never arrived. The phone doesn't call reception either. We wanted to go to a mall on a Sunday. Google said it was closed so we checked with concierge. The lady told us it was open and even recommended a specific Centre. We went there and it was closed.

Disappointed,"Although the bathroom is spacious, the lighting is poor. We travelled with another family and all the rooms had different storage and lighting which was unusual.
Non beer drinks were highly priced and the service in the upper restaurant was slow and inconcisist. 
We had some issues with rudeness from the restaurant staff and didn't feel very welcome at times. 
The sunbeds come at a cost. £10 per morning AND per afternoon, per bed.. You can pre book or ask on the day,  they all have a reserved sign on all day until they are in use, so don't assume that they have actually been reserved. 
There wasn't really an area you could sit without buying food or drink, which is a shame as there was a few of us, but this may be because it is a city stay. Breakfast didn't suit our needs but it was enough to keep us going. Had to ask for things to be topped up as they weren't checking. 
We did unfortunately have a few issues with this hotel (including hoovering while we ate dinner/80 year old family member being asked to move while reading at a table, as they weren't buying anything), but after they were brought to the managers attention, some steps were made to improve these concerns. . 
I have stayed in many places, but I have never felt unwelcome or had the need to complain before. It was a shame as it has potential.","On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the lovely and helpful concierge Nikos; nothing was too much trouble. Check in was smooth and the reception staff were lovely. All communal areas were spacious and clean. Our rooms on the 12th floor were newly refurbished. . I felt the bed was super comfy, but my husband did not. The food in the upper restaurant was lovely and of an average cost. The pool area is a great addition on a hot day.

No pool or toilet roll but nice hotel,"The pool was closed and they kept making the date for opening later, meaning when we left it still was closed. We weren’t informed at time of booking and we only picked the hotel because of the pool (over other hotels that had open pools). Obviously they don’t want to inform people as otherwise people won’t stay but it’s not really fair and is something that we should have been informed about at booking. We did enjoy the beach but it’s very far away and we thought we’d be going to the pool every day, whereas we ended up going to the beach once.
The other thing is the toilet roll?? They gave us one roll to begin with and then wouldn’t replace it (one day we had to ask 3 times). Even when servicing the room, they didn’t give us any more and one time took away the only little bit we had so we had to call reception and then a few hours later go down and ask again… I think they may want you to buy a pack from the supermarket rather than give toilet roll out to people.","Breakfast was nice, the room was big, generally nice hotel, good location out of the city but easy to get to.

"A lovely hotel, great room and very good staff. Just a bit of a walk to tourist attractions:)","There was some confusion when I asked for an extra night stay.  On check in, the reception advised that as long as I informed the reception on the day of check out before 11:00am there would be no problem to extend my stay for one extra night.  However, I informed reception the night before check out that I would like to extend my stay for one night extra and that caused a whole load of confusion. So I feel that all staff should know the same information, this caused a little bit of stress on my side as I was told that another person had been booked into my room the day I was due to check out!! I was ask to come to reception again on the day of check out to see what could be done. I did and there was no problem at all. The day time reception staff sorted the extra night and I got to stay in the same room, easy.  The only other negative was the amount of times I had to keep ringing room service to bring me some milk portions for my cuppa.  not enough portions left in the rooms.  Really, 2 milk portions, come on Hotel President you can do better than that, for a 4* hotel I would expect better.  Room Service staff were very efficient though and brought what I needed very quickly which was greatly appreciated:)    I wouldn't normally winge about something so small but I do feel that this small detail can be easily improved!","On check in I was put into one of the newly refurbished room which was lovely. Staff at reception desk upon chek in were attentive and informative.

NOT a 4* hotel!  Better off elsewhere.,"Really disappointed as paid premium for the last two days of our trip.  It is not a 4* hotel at all.  The room had paper cups and no real coffee- not what I'd expect, nor is the fact that they charge for sun loungers 10 E each!  Outrageous! An hour after we arrived we popped out and someone had entered the room - left the electricity card in the slot.  Nothing taken but very upsetting especially as the safe box didn't work. Staff that evening seemed to blame me saying I should have put the do not disturb sign out ...having just checked in!.  The small fridge didn't work which meant food we had from our self-catering trip to use for picnics in town, went off. It was replaced when we asked the next day, so at least could chill water.

Disappointing,"The rooftop pool was closed, and so was the rooftop terrace. Considering that this is the hotel's USP, and is heavily advertised, this was a huge let-down. Apart from that, most of the TV channels didn't work (horrible pixellation) the room wasn't particularly well cleaned, and although there actually exists a direct access from the car park to the hotel, in practice you have to take your luggage round the street and in through the front entrance. Below the standard you would expect in a 4 star hotel, and poor value for money. Without the rooftop pool it's hard to see why you would want to pay the fairly steep price to stay here, especially when you add on the 17 Euro per day parking costs, so check that the pool is open before booking.","Comfortable room with a good view over the city.

Athens Trip,"Some negative things that didn't affect the trip too much but that might be worth mentioning are:
-At check-in we had to pay a local tax that you apparently pay in Athens of €50 which was not mentioned anywhere when you booked the hotel.
-It took quite a long time to check in, you should be able to improve that / or have machines where you can do your own check-in.
-There is no electrical outlet in the bathroom.

- We wanted to get a room preferably with a nice view, just as preferably higher up in the hotel. But we got our room almost at the bottom against a facade / wall even though we know there were free rooms that we could have got higher up.

The extra charges they are trying to make is a concern,See above,"President is one of my favourite hotels in Europe, and I travel a lot. The staff are generally fantastic, helpful and some remember me from previous stays. 

What irks me is that instead of one consolidated price when you book, they are looking for add ons. This year they want you to pay 10 to 20 euros for a deck chair! Outrageous! 

I met some people who take almond in their coffee. The hotel doesn’t have almond milk so I watched the lady be hassled twice for drinking coffee from an outside supplier. Her group of 14 was staying 8 days, so you would think it would be ok, logic went out the window 

I was swimming one morning and I had ordered some food. The food is overpriced and sometimes bland but as I like to eat at the pool bar, I can tolerate it. As I was in the water a waitress came to ask me if I could pay. Seriously! Let the customer swim and gently ask later on for payment especially when they have been paying for stuff and staying at the hotel. 

Wifi drops out a lot. It reminds of the years when you had to pay for wifi here. Joke not 

To cut some more corners, this four star hotel now has the very cheap shampoo, replacing the little bottles with fixed larger bottles that are wedged into the bathroom and sink. It’s really average stuff 

The safe of course didn’t work. Happens often

My stay here for once included what I paid for, an actual double bed instead of the two singles joined together 

I have fond memories of this place and it’s well staffed, except for the 70 minutes you can wait for food. Therefore it pains me to give them an average review but they need to be smart about how they make their extras without antagonising customers.

Disappointing; wouldn’t book again.,"The reception staff were very snooty; no smile, no human interaction, no warmth. 
Upon reading that we were staying for one night before travelling on to an island; the person who checked us in seemed to totally disengage which was hard given that the starting point was so unfriendly anyway.
The staff at the rooftop pool were incredibly cool (not like any other Greek people / Greek staff we have encountered on the rest of the trip) at one point one of the waitresses banged the bill which was open on the table saying “Can you pay me now please!” It would be shocking anywhere; but at a four star hotel it’s just totally unexpected.
The room was shabby; needed an update five years ago.
It smelt stale and smoky upon entry; whilst we had requested a non smoking room.
Thankfully even a very disappointing hotel couldn’t spoil our feelings about Athens: what an incredible city!!!!","The concierge were SO friendly, so helpful.
Location was fantastic, the lobby was beautifully set out.

nice hotel but a lot of down sides specially the phone that went missing and triple room not ready!,"The breakfast was average and the staffs were not specially kind. Another down side was that I left my phone on the bed the last day before we went out for a city tour and when I got back to the hotel, the phone wasn't there anymore. I called it few time and nobody answered it so I have reported it to the reception. And then I tried to call it again and that was the time somebody answered it saying that it was in the laundry wrapped in the blankets; which is very weird because I left my phone charging in the room so I would really be surprised if the house keeping just accidentally wrapped it in the blanket. So beware of this! I didn't even receive any excuse or any explanation about this incident, so that is really a bad point for the hotel unfortunately! The other thing was the aircon in our room wasn't working so we needed to move to another one and we have booked a triple room but when we've checked in the third bed was not even prepared and toiletries and other stuffs were missing too and we didn't expect that the third bed would be a sofa bed so that was a minus point too because it wasn't comfortable at all!",The Hotel was really nice and we were booked in the renovated rooms so that is really nice!

"Exceptional reception, plush beds, rooftop views and bustling breakfasts","We had some noisy neighbors and you could sometimes hear conversations of people walking down the hall, but earplugs can fix that. Note that whether you booked a 1 night or 5 night stay, you only get two complimentary waters in the fridge. You can purchase water at the lobby, though it's cheaper to walk 5-10 min down the road and get a big bottle from one of those pop-up stands if you're staying a while. The metro station isn't too far of a walk away, but the sidewalks won't be easy to traverse if you have some big heavy bags.","The beds were very comfortable and the shampoos provided were very pleasant. The in-room small fridge was helpful and we were able to get a view of the Acropolis from our room! This hotel was a bit further from the conference centre (travelled for work), but the 25min walk was worth it to have the rooftop pool access and the rooftop restaurant views. The breakfast buffet was optional for a fee, but a great deal if you're looking for variety and a nice cappuccino machine (local cafes are nice for coffee and some baking but are not cheap). Note that this hotel seems to be used a lot for big groups so you may want to make a reservation for breakfast if you don't want to wait for a free table during the busy 8-9:30am rush.

We walked up to the reception to check in and the receptionist blankly stared at me, no welcome how can I help, until I had to say hi I’d like to check in. It was such a strange first experience after coming from Naxos where everyone was so lovely and helpful.

We were told we were not allowed any food or drinks from outside the hotel in the hotel. This is obviously to make the most money out of the guests, despite the fact the food at the hotel is sub par.

Once we were in our room it was extremely disappointing, really old decor, 2 single beds instead of a double, the air con once on blew dust and dirt into the room as it hadn’t been cleaned, the towels smelled old and damp when wet, the shower only works if the bath tap runs at the same time, the cups provided were paper like a cheap coffee shop, there were stains everywhere, the hair dryer was about 50 years old. 
This place is so dirty and old.

We went down to reception to complain and say we weren’t happy but I was told that’s the room I booked and if I wanted to change I had to pay.
Why would I want to give this hotel anymore of my money? 

The only nice area is the pool but we we asked for an umbrella for the intense heat from the sun they said no it’s a health and safety issue. 

The area isn’t a good one for Athens, staying in Plaka would have been a lot better. The area was run down and you had to taxi anywhere, no very many good restaurants. The only plus on the area is the great bakery opposite the hotel. 

I would avoid this place at all costs!!! 
I’m sure I will get a reply to this review from a manager trying to pretend it was fine but please don’t stay here, there are so many other better places in Athens.",1.0,June 2022,"June 22, 2022",Standard Double or Twin Room,3,Couple,8.1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0011695388751333652
"All were good, thank you!",,"I stayed here 8 years ago, too. 
The location of the hotel is perfect; just between Panormou and Ampellokipoi metro stations and it takes only afew stops to get to Sytagma and Monastraki.
It is a safe place. 
The hotel is very clean. Compared to my previous stay, it looks much more cleaner as it has ben renewed. Nice. 
The personnel are all very kind and helpful. 
The continental breakfast is satisfying. There were one sort of white cheese which was something ""like"" feta and one type of very thin sliced fresh stager cheese. Both were okay. There were two types of olives, kalamata and green olives, which were nice. I did not get any deli meat products for personal choices. Fruits were nice, fresh and clean.
Just (frankly and friendly) saying; the ""nice"" continental breakfast might even be upgraded into a much satisfying level by just a little effort. For instance, adding some greenstuff (that is characteristic to the Mediterranean) to the open buffet  like bundles of peppergrass, rocket salad, parsley and etc might work. Comparing to my previous stay, I can say that cheese, olive and deli meat product choices were reduced. There was only turkey jambon apart from ham, loukániko, sausage and etc made of pork. During my previous visit, I remember there were many choices of deli meat products of lamb&beef, different sorts of cheese and many types of olives.",9.0,April 2024,"April 16, 2024",Classic Triple Room,4,Family,8.1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0011695388751333652

Poor supply of tea and coffee and tea making stuff in the room despite providing a kettle. We had to ask every morning and we prepared beverages only once a day. Should be routine to replace with room service

"Disappointed, never again","The hotel is rather old, not really looking as  4 star, the shower head could only stay in one position and it was not easy to wash my hair, water was going around the room because of the design of the shower, most towels were rather old, I got very happy when I had the second day a nice newer fluffy towel, which should not be the highlight of a 4 start hotel, but I must say it was.
We had to wait a lot at the checkin, although they had 3 receptions, but the speed was slow 
Also, it's unfortunate that the pool is only open between 10:00-19:00 because this is the time when most people are busy or out. It would be nice to have a refreshing swim in the evening when coming back to the hotel but the pool it is already closed so it's a facility that is almost inaccessible. Also, the side of the pool is very slippery and I saw a lady falling down while I managed to pass by for 10 min.
The restaurant of the hotel is unfortunately too focused on international dishes with no specific greek food.","The breakfast had many options: 2 types of pies, nice omlet with mushrooms, many warm side dishes, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, sweet options",6.0,July 2023,"July 20, 2023",Standard Double or Twin Room,2,Family,8.1,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0.0011624347807794079

I called at 11:30 pm to order a bottle of wine and they refused, though that is their prerogative I find it to be not good for their customer service image plus they chose to lose the money for 3 minutes.","Refurbished rooms, it must have cost them but was definately worth it.

really amazing,"location - obviously not much the hotel can do about this! - is about 10 min walk or just under that, to the metro underground which in the heat meant we couldn't just ""pop back to the hotel"" in the middle of the day as slightly further out.

Also, I have few words about the staff, I've stayed in many hotels in Greece generally and I've never felt unwelcome. The front desk needs improvement in my opinion.

I stayed at your hotel recently and experienced a few issues that must be addressed.

Firstly, the air conditioning in the room was weak and insufficient to cool the room adequately, which affected our comfort.

Secondly, on the last day of our stay, we had to remain at the hotel for a few hours after checkout due to a late flight. We ordered food delivery from outside, but the staff did not allow us to eat inside the hotel, even in an isolated area. The doorman even followed us inside to ensure we were not eating. Eventually, we were asked to go outside (in 40-degree heat) and eat in the street, which we did despite explaining that we were still guests, we f.

Stay away from the headache,"What a headache this hotel was. Booked a standard classic room with airco, classic turning out to be code term for urgent need for renovation. The stay in first designated room was super uncomfortable because air-conditioning didn't work. Also the curtains were broken. Hotel staff gave quite a hard time and just said that they were fully booked. After much discussion and raised voices especially from the male staff, went to second room. This place seemed to have an ok airco, but the mold was quite easy to smell. Again we had to have an intense discussion with the staff, until finally a new room was given. So after moving for third time, it seemed this one was new and functioning. The bulk of rooms are in desperate need of renovation though. Sad that more guests didn't understand that the lobby was beautiful, but behind this facade many complaints were felt. For sure this place is not worth the money and the four stars.

If you are tempted to book because of the rooftop pool- Don’t!,"Really disappointed with the hotel. We booked this hotel as a treat at the end of our holiday because of the pool. However, despite it being advertised as free (including the sun loungers and umbrellas on booking.com) it is not. Upon arrival we were informed there is a 10 euro fee per lounger. So for myself and my two kids that’s 30 euros.  I was reluctant but willing to pay that, but when we got to the pool was informed that it is 30 euros for the morning session (10-2) and another 30 for the afternoon session (2-7). We had afternoon plans so only wanted to use the pool from 12-3 but was told this would be 60 euros. If you buy food or drinks you are allowed to sit at a table under the awning but still have to pay for the sun lounger. There are no other seats or areas to sit. There is a bench that you’re ‘allowed’ to put your towel on. You can’t even just sit on the floor! This is an outrageous way to treat the hotel guests and essentially means the pool is not available unless you pay. This is contrary to what is advertised on booking.com and not at all clear or transparent on the hotel website or at check in. I tried to speak to a manager about the situation as two members of staff had agreed it was unreasonable but told it’s ‘policy’.  However the manager was in a meeting and I was told to come back later. I left my room number but the manager made no effort to speak and resolve the issues.

Additionally, the hotel seems set up for large group bookings where inevitably all the members of the group do the same thing at the same time. This means if you unfortunately arrive for breakfast at the same time it’s chaos- not enough tables, food and the communal areas were at times really crowded and congested.

We also had a cockroach in our bathroom and needed to change rooms. The hotel is also about 30 walk and metro from the centre. The latter issues, we don’t really care about (especially the distance from centre as our plan had been to spend the day at the pool)",The variety of food at the breakfast was good,2.0,August 2024,"August 8, 2024",Classic Triple Room,2,Family,8.1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0.0009709638211939882

Worth paying a little more for another hotel that has better service and less added costs.,"Breakfast repetitive. You have to pay for almost everything. EURO 20 for use of sunbeds!

Really looked forward to this stay but was immensely disappointed,"Firstly - so money hungry. I stayed at this hotel as I saw the weather in Athens and wanted somewhere I could just really chill out and reset on my trip. But when the gym set me back €8 each visit and the pool sun beds another €10, a very sour taste was left in my mouth about this concept entirely. Also, while the gym was (slightly) bigger than normal hotel gyms, the equipment and machines were dated and the only good things were the treadmills. 
Secondly - the pool was dirty. I feel as though if you’re even just staying at a hotel, yet alone paying for a sun bed, the pool should be pristine but when I went to swim I could see little pieces of rubbish and tissue floating around. 
Thirdly - the location. While I’m sure fine if you’re willing to fork out on taxis etc, if you want to stay in the heart of Athens look elsewhere. I found myself walking 50 mins daily just to get to the heart of Athens. Yes, there is a train line however not in close proximity to the hotel. 
Finally, as someone incredibly susceptible to mould, I was not happy with the facilities. There was mould in the shower head and some of the bathroom facilities just seemed dated. 
I was really looking forward to this stay, and while I absolutely loved Athens, I will certainly not be staying here again given the price tag and extras … can’t say I have ever had to pay to use hotel facilities before.",Super comfortable and the pool view was insane,6.0,July 2023,"July 21, 2023",Standard Double or Twin Room,4,Solo traveler,8.1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0009180812165255358

"old hotel, poor maintenance,, does not match 4 * hotel standard,  unpleasant experience","This hotel is located by the main road. A lot of heavy motorcycles make loud traffic noise almost all night. The sealing of the windows are in the poor maintenance condition. It can not prevent the street's traffic noise. The hotel was built in 1978. There are not enough sockets in the room. Two chairs have different textile and different colors. Sink leaks. Quite slow wifi speed makes watching streaming videos almost impossible. Parking garage is located outside the hotel. There is no indoor connect between the two buildings. The hotel has no efficient measure to prevent guest from smoking in the room.
We changed 2 rooms, stayed 3 rooms on the 1st and 2sec floor during the 4 nights, In the room 1 someone in another room was smoking and the smell can not make us fall in sleep, , when A/C on the air smells like strong urines smell, In the room 2 quite loud street traffic noise and disturbing blue light from a router installed in a room., fridge does not work completely.  In the room 3 tiled stand light. Current the hotel is under renovation  pretty disturbing hammer drills the concrete wall  noise can be heard during 9:00-16:30 if you stay in the room.
Although there is a penthouse open air view platform the view is just the Lycabettus Hill Acropolis and downtown is almost blocked by the hill.

Use of pool was only allowed at a extra charge of €10 per person. Which wasn't included in booking.com property details.

Feels like this hotel is lacking income and trying to make ends meet by charging for every little extra. I wouldn't rate this hotel as a four star. In my opinion it's a 3 star.

BE FLEXIBLE!!!! That’s how you get returning customers.,"The metro was a long walk with suitcases at least 20 mins.

We were bitterly disappointed, as this hotel was booked for 2 x nights months and months ago through booking.com to align with a booking the cruise line had made for 2 x extra nights. The cruise line changed their booking to another hotel. Both myself and Booking.com requested a goodwill cancellation over 3 x months ago, but your hotel declined our repeated requests. 

Where was the goodwill customer service and exception to the rule, President Hotel????

Come on President Hotel!!! I could understand 1 or 2 weeks not wanting to cancel, but three months b4hand … that is a joke!!!

Hotel Trapovannia?,"I never like to leave bad reviews, however, I feel like it would do the public a disservice to NOT voice my concerns. 

We checked in with one of the receptionists who had a terrible attitude. We asked if there was possibly a room on the upper floor that we could change to and she gave us a look, then responded with ""you paid for the cheapest room."" Even if English isn't your first language, there is no reason to treat your guests with this level of disdain. 

The next morning, we went to check out the pool, which seemed to be the bread and butter of this hotel's attraction point, and were appalled to find garbage in the water. We then informed the front desk and the lady said ""you need to talk to the people upstairs."" They are the representative of the hotel and at least they could've said they'll forward the message to their staff. 

Lastly, the room reeked of urine and mold. It was a wholly unpleasant experience and I sincerely hope the hotel management reads this and makes some conscious effort to change their ways.

Best part of hotel is the pool,Paying for the rooftop pool. It should be a facility included in the price of the booking. Also they should do poolside food and beverage service I feel they are missing out money by not having that service.
