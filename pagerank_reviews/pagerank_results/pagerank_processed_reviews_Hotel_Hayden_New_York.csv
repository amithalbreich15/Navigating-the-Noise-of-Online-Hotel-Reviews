Great location for a trip to New York,"There were a few scuffs and marks in the room, on walls. The rooftop bar looks tired and dated, and the breakfast was very disappointing so we had to find this elsewhere.","The room was clean and comfortable, and the location was great for exploring New York.

Good location but some improvements could be made,"The heating in the room didn’t heat up our room, was cold most of the time. The temperature of the shower was lukewarm, you could also hear the loft from our room so every time someone used it you could hear it. Breakfast was abysmal, not sure you can even call it “offering breakfast”. It was just pastries, some fruit and yogurt and strange coffee machines that only filled one cup at a time, this took forever and resulted in many people crowding around the machines waiting for their cups etc… just do yourself a favour and have breakfast elsewhere, which is what we did after the first day. The rooftop bar is not open, not sure whether this is a seasonal thing or whether it’s just closed permanently.","The hotel was in a good location, the room was clean and an adequate size for my duration.

Pleasant,"The advertised Restaurant in the facility was closed for construction and price should have been adjusted accordingly. Housekeeping are terrible. I had to ask constantly during my stay for bath Matt, towel and few other bathroom essentials. Thus, they clean every day but not replace.

Good hotel for the price and close to the centre of Manhattan,"Even though we had 4 people in our family room, we only got left towels for 2 people. The cleaners came to the rooms at random times which meant sometimes we ended up turning them away as we had just got back to our room for a rest. 

The rooftop bar was closed for the duration of our stay for refurbishment which was disappointing and the complimentary continental breakfast was very basic, not much choice and the same every day but that said, we were not actually aware this was included so it ended up being a bit of a bonus.","The hotel was pleasant enough, clean albeit some of the furniture was a little dated - the staff were very friendly and helpful and based on the location, the hotel was a fair price considering you could walk to Times Square in less than 10 minutes.",6.0,November 2022,"November 15, 2022",Double Room,7,Group,7.1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0.0013021886442561338
Great location and nice customer service,The toilet got clogged up pretty easily and took a while until the send someone in the room to unblock it. But not really a big deal.,"I got in a little earlier and I was allowed to do an early check-in once the room was ready and I was also allowed to do a late check-out, pretty good service, which nowadays not all the hotels are providing anymore.

The view of the room was nice and very good location, a walking distance to most of the landmarks and also pretty near a metro station, making accessible to everything around, even the main metro station which gives access to the airport is as near as 10min walk",9.0,May 2023,"August 6, 2023",King Room - Disability Access,1,Solo traveler,7.1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0012989723226776739

Will return.  Thank you very much.,"See above: pillows, shower structure, breakfast room lighting.  The room was surprisingly nice, and I was surprised because the lobby is a little shabby. So the room was a real pleasure because it was not run down at all.","Good firm bed. Pillows were too soft, but bed was so comfortable that it overcame the pillows. Location is perfectly convenient to the #1 train. The Flower District is a wonderful neighborhood. Room was quite large for a NYC room at the price, quite surprising. Shower was hot & powerful, but the structure of the shower cabinet is terrible. It's difficult to shower without wetting the floor despite a towel down. Lots of unexpected supplies in the bathroom: dental kit, 
                 shaving kit, etc. Excellent breakfast: many choices and delicious. Lighting in breakfast room is terrible. It looks like disco lighting.

A comfortable stay in a great location.,One very minor thing - the coffee machines at breakfast were extremely slow. Didn't need the air conditioning as we stayed there in October but I am not sure how effective it would be if we had needed it.,"The location was great. Close to many of the main tourist attractions and also next to a subway station, Madison Square Gardens and Penn Station. The room was clean, the bed was big and extremely comfortable and our room was serviced every day. Miniature toiletries were provided and a hair dryer.

Decent hotel with decent staff.,"The shower. There was no door so the bathroom floor gets soaked. There were only 2 towels.  The next morning me, my partner, and son all had to share a towel used the previous night. I went to front desk to ask for more towels that never came. There was also a weird looking device on the wall that when I looked up the model number only thing to come up was a camera.

"Excellent location, one of the most convenient stays in Manhattan.","Only one thing I did not like, the bed had a metal bar sticking out of the bed frame. There was not much space in the aisle because of that piece of metal and we hit our shins a few times.

Meh. Probably wouldn't stay here again.,"Everything here was kinda dingy. The water in the bathroom sink splashed everywhere. There was a constant beep from a smoke alarm that needed a new battery. The remote control for the TV was really pretty filthy (visibly).

Disappointing and not as advertised.,"A strange hotel and experience. It was very scruffy outside and always rubbish/pallets/boxes stacked up there and reception. The bar and restaurant advertised was closed but they did provide a continental breakfast free of charge. Having tried the breakfast I was very disappointed, it was served in the closed bar. All paper cups and plates and very little to choose from. The tables in there were chipped and scruffy and food on the floor. 
The bedroom I was in felt like it had been badly renovated, gaps in the laminate floor, paint splashed on the floor/furniture and air con controls loose and not connected correctly. It had an interconnecting door which provided no sound proofing to the room next door and I unfortunately had some very loud neighbours for two of the three nights.

- Showers (in our King room atleast) had two options only. Very hot or VERY cold. There was nothing inbetween. But the hotel free essencials were so nice (shampoo, vanity kit tms)
- Wifi was very very bad in the hotel room. We bought an eSIM for our trip. Made life easier when investigating the city also.
- Non-Noise cancellation rooms tms is something you need to be ready in NYC. Sirens are to be heard all the time from morning to night hours. Rooms had blackout curtains tho that were amazing.","Hotels best parts:
- location is SO GOOD. (times square 1km, central park 3km tms, close to everything)
- neighbourhood was super nice. Calm and felt safe even when I was walking alone (as a woman). Some homeless people but they dont bother nobody.
- subway/metro (number 1) is super close. Metro is very easy to use once you figure it out. Take the unlimited ride metrocard for 7 days (34$)!
- breakfast included in price. It wasnt super big but it was very nice. Coffee/Tea/Hot Choco, Pastries and croissants, yoghurt and fruits.

To sum it up I will not stay at this Hotel again.,"First, I really do not like giving poor reviews, however I really must say this, the heat in the Hotel was out of control. It was soo hot we had to open the window, which only opened about 2 or three inches and didnt do much good. We were sitting in our underwear and sweating and two of my grandchildren had nose bleeds. There was mold around the bottom of the glass panel in the shower. And the room was tiny compared to what I am accustomed to. When we went for breakfast on Sunday, there was a semblence of a continental breakfast, pastries and muffins donuts and coffee. Not a lot for children to eat. We had to purchase breakfast for my grandchildren from outside the hotel. It would have been nice to have juice, milk, cereal. Also the dining area for breakfast was also a storage spot. I definetly will not stay at this hotel again.","The location was wonderful, it was only a couple of blocks away from Candytopia, which is where we were going on Saturday.

It looks run down, and OUR MAIN REASON for booking it, was the rooftop bar/restaurant. SURPRISEEE , closed for renovation (would be nice to mention that on booking before you book it!)

This was a nice stay.,I think the breakfast should've had some savory options. Also maybe a microwave in the hotel would be nice to heat up leftovers. I basically couldn't eat my leftovers because of this. Also the air conditioning only went down to 68 which left my friend and I sweating while we sleep.

I would not have booked it because I never reserve a 3 star hotel! So it was  booking.com’s fault for ending up in this hotel.

A NYC hotel that assumes location makes up for giving guests a poor experience.,"The room was on the second floor and had a dungeon like feel looking out onto HVAC equipment.  There were holes in the wall and dried paint spatter on the floor and on the furniture.  The phone did not work and the cord of the phone was covered in dried paint.  There were no hangers in the room when I arrived.  It took more than a half hour to get hangers brought to my room.  I had to use my cell phone to call reception because the in room phone did not function. Then I took a shower and realized there was no hair dryer in the room.  This took another half hour to solve.

The area is used as storage so you eat amongst boxes. Staff would not acknowledge you unless you said good morning etc. WiFi above floor 12 doesn’t work!

As many people mentioned in their reviews, staff at the reception desk doesn't really say hi to people passing by them. 

We had an issue with the smoke detector alarm in our room (which had both wires and batteries), due to malfunction it was beeping every 5 to 10 minutes through 11pm to the next morning. We called reception to come look at it but they just said mechanic is not in and there is nothing they can do about it. We asked to be moved to another room just for the night, but they said they will check and never rang our room back, so we had no sleep that night. We tried everything and wraped a towel around it. Next day we went to ask them if the mechanic is coming, and the lady at the reception thought this was fixed and batteries were changed, which was completely false, never happened. Not even a simple apology for the sleepless night or any kind of compensation.","We were a little bit afraid to book this hotel after reading all the reviews, however it is actually not as bad as some people say here.

It’s a ‘big deal’ to us and we’d expect staff to react appropriately. 2) Elevator wasn’t working one morning and so we tried to use stairs - only to discover the stairway ends in the basement (no entry to lobby!) of the next building). When we told front desk clerk about the broken elevator, she literally ignored us.  Overall, for the amount we paid for the room, we expected a much better experience.

Location is good but hotel is not worth staying at,We were on the 12th floor and of the two elevators only one was working. At times we had to wait for 10-15 minutes to get up to the room or down to the street. Room cleaning wasn't done properly every day. The bed was sensitive to movements to the level where you wake up the other person if you turn around or get up. The business center/work desks area is not suitable for doing calls.

Wonderful Stay at Hotel Hayden and NYC Experience.,There wasn't anything that stood out to us that we didn't like. This hotel was exactly what we needed during NYE.,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at Hotel Hayden, situated in the vibrant NOMAD area of NYC, and I wanted to share my delightful experience. Being a native New Yorker myself, this trip was more about showing my girlfriend the less touristy side of the city, and our choice to stay at Hotel Hayden proved to be perfect for this purpose.

Location and Accessibility:
The hotel's location is ideal for anyone looking to explore the heart of New York City. It's conveniently within walking distance to Herald Square, ESB, MSG, Times Square, 5th Avenue, and Central Park. We appreciated the ease of parking our car at the Icon lot just around the corner, where the hotel's parking validation offered a more affordable rate. There's also a wine store and two pharmacies less than 5 minutes away.

Easter Egg: As you walk out of the hotel, and make a right to 6th Ave, when you get to the corner, look up and to the left! 

Dining Options Galore:
One of the highlights of Hotel Hayden’s location is being surrounded by an array of dining options. From fast food to local bars and restaurants, we were spoilt for choice. We enjoyed exploring places like The Grey Dog, The Keg Room, The Harold, and Friedman's - all easily accessible on foot. Although the hotel offers breakfast, we chose to delve into the local culinary scene instead.

Exceptional Service:
The warmth and friendliness of the Hotel Hayden staff added to the charm of our stay. Their courteous and welcoming approach every time we interacted was notable and contributed to the overall positive experience. The service was undoubtedly A+!

Hotel Hayden not only provided us with a comfortable stay but also positioned us perfectly to experience New York City in its true essence. It was a fantastic trip to ring in the New Year, and your hotel played a significant part in making it special.

Then once returning from a show at 10pm was told the roof top was closed due to a private party. So what are we getting at this property for $330. No pool, no continental breakfast, no mints on pillow , no tooth paste and tooth brush just a one night stay with a bed.  The front desk guy earned this property 4 stars wasnt happy with the false advertising but overall nice stay.",The room was nice and the temperature was comfortable and it was clean.

I was not pleased or impressed with this hotel.,"Where do I start? The hotel looks nothing like the pictures. The room is small and could use some upgrades. The lamp flickered on and off just by the  touch of  the desk. I noticed how hot the room was and I advised the front desk there was an issue with the air. The entire time I was there, which was 4 days,  the room temperature was 77 degrees. I was not offered another room nor was I refunded any money. The breakfast is a joke! There was only rotten fruit, dry muffins, and yogurt. The only beverage offered was coffee. There was no water or juice available. The breakfast area  appeared to be a storage area. There was pictures and other items in a pile in the floor making it difficult to maneuver at the bar area. The linen needs to replaced immediately. So I would suggest bringing your own towels and wash cloths. The refrigerator is beyond a mini fridge. There is no room to put anything in it.  Before checking out, I scanned the room over to be sure I didn’t forget anything. Under the bed I found clothes and a bag left from another guest. I would not suggest this hotel!","Honestly, the only thing I liked about the hotel was the the staff.

Yes, we need to check in.

Finally get up to our room and it is only set for one person. One bath towel, one wash cloth, one hand towel. Had to go back downstairs and wait for towels because no one answered the phone to the front desk. Waited another 20 minutes for this. Was told breakfast was from 6-10. Not that we really even planned on eating breakfast there, but it was an absolute joke. See photo. Asked for bottle of water - to purchase even - and were told there was “no bottled water on property”. What kind of establishment doesn’t even offer bottled water for purchase?

The fridge didn’t work wich I also tried to make them aware of 3 times, the door to the room was extremely hard to open and close, wich resulted in the door being left open a few times. 
Had to ask for toilet paper regardless that it had been left more for two days. 

I payed 5200 dollars for 2 weeks, and even though NY is expensive, this was the worst experience I’ve ever had with a hotel compared to price as well. I felt like a below 1 star experience.

Comfortable lodging in Midtown Manhattan,"The phone in room 1402 was dead. After several complaints at the front desk, an engineer came to verify that the phone did not work. He stated that the phone had not been upgraded. He looked for working phones in other rooms. He could not find one. At the front desk I was told that I could move to another room. I simply stayed in 1402 and used my mobile phone.

The safe did not work. After several complaints at the front desk, an engineer came to verify that the safe needed to be set. After multiple attempts to reset the safe, he determined that the batteries needed to be replaced. He replaced the batteries. The safe then worked fine.

The latch on the door of 1402 was a millimeter lower then the knob on the door frame. Because they did not match, I could not lock the room inside the room.

"This hotel needs better management but some staff were lovely, but some deserved not even a Penny!","Air conditioning was automatically set by front desk computer system @68F fan, ive attentively complained about it in person and over the service call for them to set to cool 67F cool, because the room system on wall would not let me change to cool or lower from 68F to 67 or to 66! None of the health concern I had towards my dog was cared for which my dog that same day had sedative dental extractions while AC I believe was being switched by front desk computer from 66F cool back to 68F fan in matter of minutes or their system was being hacked! My dog I believe had a mini heat stroke as he kept bringing me back downstairs to lobby about 7 or 9 times and the hotel did not transfer me and my dog to another room. My check in time they gave me was between 3-4pm on 06/22/22 to check out time noon on 06/24/2022. My dog had a sedation appointment on June 23rd, 2022 from 8am. After I had brought my dog back from doctors sedative 11 extractions, my dog was crying, in pain and when i tried to bring him up to the room to care for his pain, elevator was not excepting my room card which also functions elevator, i returned to the front desk and was told that 'who ever checked you in had this card activated only for 24 hrs'! So the person who checked me in originally had given me a hard time checking me in with my government issued ID plus i had given him my credit card after he stated that my card information he has on booking.com but he still needs to swipe the card in their system! The bathroom had no antibacterial soap and instead shampoo and glad i had sanitizer hand wipes in my bag that i carry at all times along a hand sanitizer spray!

It was not a good trip for me due to this stay at this sorry hotel,The pictures on the site are not luxurious as the the real thing.   The entire room was extremely dusty for starters the baseboards were all warped and the paint was chipped away.  One of my end tables was broken.

"This hotel is just horrible, do not go there.","We booked a familiar room (3 people) accessible with wheelchair and it turned out that, even though it was advertised as accessible, it wasn’t. A person alone on a wheelchair wasn’t able to open the room’s door, nor any other in the hotel, since they are very heavy and the automatic buttons to open them don’t work at all.
Many things in the room were broken (handle of the bathroom door, the main ceiling light in the bathroom was broken and not working - thus we only had a little mirror light for the whole bathroom, the mirror was broken, a drawar handle was broken and fell off just by walking close to it, we had no safe in the room even though we were supposed to have one).
When we confronted the staff about these flaws they always replied by saying that they would send someone to have a look but this never happened.
The cleaning service was very poor both in the room and in the public areas.
The staff was very indifferent towards the guests and their needs (we confronted other guests about the conditions of the hotel and they were all upset as we were).
The area is not safe at all, cosidering that some beggars slept on the forniture right outside of the hotel’s main door.
When we checked in the first day we were given two room (instead of a familiar for 3 people) because the technicians were supposedly fixing something in the room we had booked (but given the status of the familiar room described above I really can’t see what was fixed). Plus, the following day reception moved us to our original room, but to do so we were requested to check out from our two provisional rooms early morning and only after 15 pm we were given access to the familiar room, thus staying half a day without any room (and no compensation whatsoever was applied nor proposed).
Lastly, during one of the night somone managed to open our room’s door from the outside and tried to get in.

Violated and poor customer service!,"Upon checking in on Friday 2/17 not a big deal later that evening. When heading out, we complained to the front desk staff about the bathroom toilet not working properly. We were asked if maintenance could enter our room when we were not there, and of course, we stated yes.   It appeared that the toilet was never fixed. We had to endure all weekend a loud noise every time we flushed the toilet for hours.  That being one incident, the other in which I'm still dealing with, with the hotel manager named Val is jewelry that was taken from my room that was in a work bag, I've never felt so violated. When I informed the manager about it after I realized that my items were gone, I stated to her that the only individuals that entered our room were housekeeping or maintenance. The response from the manager was that she confronted housekeeping and that they stated that they would never do such a thing! I'm left with pieces of jewelry missing, and being made to feel like they did their job by confronting housekeeping.
