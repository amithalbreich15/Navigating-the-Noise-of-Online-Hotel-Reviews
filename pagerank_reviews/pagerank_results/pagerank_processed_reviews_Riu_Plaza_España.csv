Very Good,New trend of bathrooms with glass doors. The doors do not really separate the bathroom from the room and the ventilation in the bathroom is really really weak.

Excellent stay with family - highly recommend,"No indoor pool which we knew before we arrived, but I guess for a hotel of this size would have been nice as Outdoor Pool closed (due to out of season stay), so having both would be great addition and provide options for guests","Excellent location

Perfect location with perks,Sometimes the waiting time for any of 6 lifts is very long. The TV was set literally in the middle of our room which made it impossible to watch TV from both beds at the same time. The safe in the room was initially not working due to batteries left inserted the wrong way.,"The location was superb with many primary landmarks and attractions in walking distance. The underground and numerous busses are just at a corner. The view is magnificent. The priority access to sky bar for the guests is a life saving perk on Friday and Saturday nights. The staff is plenty, easy to find and very helpful. Breakfast is of descent variety and good quality. The checkout took less than 3 seconds. The main bed was enormously large and pretty comfortable. The furniture in the room was sufficient to keep the room tidy.

Wonderful,"Room was a bit drafty, probably due to the old windows.
In order to get the vent/AC going, one must first use a lot of force to close the windows and get them correctly positioned.

Belated birthday celebration.,"The pillows in the room. Too soft. I struggled to sleep well, but that’s just me.","This hotel was amazing. When I booked it I hadn’t realised it had the breath taking sky bar so that was a major bonus. The staff were excellent , the room very nice. We were on the 21st floor which was quieter and had great views. Location was very good and we were able to walk everywhere. Breakfasts were super. So much choice. Totally worth every penny that we paid. The sky bar was superb. Busy so you have to pick your time. The 360 views of Madrid were fantastic.

"Great location, great breakfast, great staff and great breakfast.",Room was too warm for us from UK.,"Great location. All important monuments and park are within walking distance of 15-20 mts of gradual pace.
All the plazas like de Sol, isabella2 etc are within walking distance. Lots of eating places are within easy reach by walk. Rooms are average size for delux king room but toilet with shower are of good size. Rooms are cleaned daily. The room is hot with no air con as it’s supposed to be winter. We stayed on 22 floor and kept windows open and still it was hot. Hotel may consider providing a fan. Hotel has sky bar with glass bridge n glass balcony for excellent views.

perfect for romantic getaway in Madrid,the only negative was that you could hear everyone walking by the corridor outside our bedroom.

Beautiful hotel in good location,"Booked king room and was given a twin room. Could have insisted we got what we booked but was only there 2 nights so let it go. 
Only one pillow per person in room and pillows were pretty poor quality compared to everything else in the hotel.

A great place to stay in Madrid,"Some relatively small, but important details that, in my opinion, would make it all absolutely perfect:
Practically nowhere to hang more than one large towel in the bathroom. And that only hook is at the quite opposite side of the bath, not at all close to the shower. There were three of us and getting the towel after the shower wasn´t easy. Please, think of a couple of hooks on the side wall of the shower.
The AC only worked to cool down, not to warm up. It´s unacceptable not to allow the guests to use the AC as they please in a 4 stars. 
The beds were only made with bed linen and it wasn´t that warm, especially since we couldn't use the AC to warm up. After asking some duvets, we were brought blankets. I don't think a blanket instead of a duvet is quite OK. 
The sofa is very firm for sleeping and quite squeaky by the way, a softer top mattress would be a great detail.","Overall great stay. Fantastic location, large, clean rooms, comfortable beds (except for the sofa bed), excellent breakfast, great service, soundproof windows (which is very, very important detail when overlooking Gran Vía and Plaza de España), blackout curtains, courtesy bottle of water, coffee (including decaff) and tea in room.

A FABULOUS MADRID WEEKEND ESCAPE!,"Our room was near the elevators, so there was some noise from hotel guests, particularly during early morning hours. The hotel didn't provide bathrobes and slippers. The responsible for seating the guests at the rooftop bar was not flexible at all, despite the fact that the re were many tables free during our visit. The bed's matress could have been more comfortable.","Great location, city center, at Plaza Espagna. Nice view of the Plaza from our room. We've selected a family room (equivalent of  a suite) that was comfortable with a spacious bathroom. The air-conditioning was noiseless and very efficient. The breakfast buffet had a very good selection of foodstuff and beverages, including  fresh juice. The customer service desk was very helpful in booking guided tours and visits.

An excellent hotel with superb service; ideally located for a vacation in Madrid.,"High tech elevators were a bit annoying.  Lobby is small for such a large hotel so frequently crowded.  Energy efficient room, so powered down when vacant.  While supportive of the green approach, this made it impossible to charge electronic devices when out of the room.  Perhaps a single outlet for low energy draw could be left enabled.","Perfect location near Royal Palace, shopping, restaurants, Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor.

Very Good,Room spacious enough but flooring would not be out of place in an hostel. Towels are equally out of place for a 'luxury ' hotel. Workmen were drilling until 11pm close to our bedroom despite several calls to reception to complain. It's always difficult to be a little negative without appearing to be a person never satisfied. Overall happy with this choice and there was much to be delighted with but the overriding impression is that some aspects particularly relating to the room furnishings and build quality do not warrant very close inspection for what purports to be a premium hotel.,"Pleasant staff, breakfast amazing. Location perfect. High tech lifts something else. Expectations for Riu Plaza Espagne were high and were met on a number of levels. Would we return here? No. I  suspect that the hotel has some floors/rooms reserved for guests paying below rack rate; Booking.com rate was highly competitive at time of making the reservation.",8.0,April 2022,"April 2, 2022",Deluxe King Room,4,Couple,9,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0004912626684661185
Very pleasant stay in a centrally located Madrid hotel - excellent value!,no complains,"The hotel is clean and provides very good amenities. Hotel's staff is pleasant and helpful. Location is also very good. 
Riu Sky Bar on the top of the building is great. The hotel patrons have unrestricted access to it. Every night there is a long line of people who want to visit the bar (these who do not stay in the hotel).
The greatest thing about this place is the value. This is an excellent hotel located very well within one of the most popular European capitals, and yet it charges very reasonable rates (including breakfast which is excellent). I think this is not by accident. I believe it is a strategic decision by Riu team to make this place full, busy and vibrant even when overall travel is significantly depressed due to pandemic.",10.0,October 2021,"October 25, 2021",Deluxe King Room,7,Couple,9,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0004887760838912181

We had an excellent time in Madrid made better by staying at the hotel.,There wasn't much I could say i didn't like but the roof top pool was a little on the cold side (and this was in August).,"Could not believe it when we stepped off the tube and there was the hotel.

The staff on reception were friendly and helpful informing us of the times of breakfasts and where things were located in the hotel. We liked the way the lifts operated - it made us feel very safe. The roof top pool was a great way to relax after a day of sightseeing and the rooftop bar (I think it was called the secret garden) was an added bonus.

They offer a wide variety of food for breakfast and there's even some gluten free options. You don't have to fight for a table since there's someone who assigns them. Good quality and many options to chose from.
Very high level of security, the elevators can only be activated with your room card which prevents anyone else from getting up.
You have unlimited access to the 360 skybar, of course the drinks aren't free but that is expected. The view from the bar is amazing and the prices are reasonable.

"Fantastic modern hotel, great location in Madrid, great food, great service - we will be back!","We had an issue with the aircon in the first night - while it was fixed quickly once we spoke to someone, the instructions our how to keep your aircon on are not clear.  If you stay and have any issues, call housekeeping straight away and they will sort it out.  And if you need a carpark, you need to approach the hotel from the left hand side, and turn right at the hotel and then right again behind the hotel - you will see the carpark entrance to your left (most likely with a doorman standing next to it).  You simply take a ticket and then pay at the end of your stay.  Car parks are small - as is often the case in Europe so be aware.  And you may need concierge's help to get out on your last day - we did!","The modern and classy style of the building;  from check-in to check-out our stay was great!  We booked a room with our own terrace and the view was stunning.

Very Good,,"Beautiful and breathtaking views, nice design indoors, friendly staff, but still it feels like a cheap hotel with not so cheap room fares. Breakfast options are huge, from cold cuts, churros, freshly made smoothies, eggs, sausages... you really have to take a full buffet tour to decide what you're gonna take, which that's something to highlight of a hotel, as that gives way more than enough options for everyone's tastes and needs. Althought food quality wasn't the best I've seen by far. Having said that, hotel's staff really make up for all the other flaws. From outstanding and friendly bellmans, to a very nice receptionist who made sure I got a room with beautiful views, and super friendly breakfast waiters. I'd also like to highlight the covid protocols, which are very strict but still offer good guest experience, as you still get ammenities such as glasses, tea/coffee facilities, and a complimentary water bottle in your room (all those have disappeared since the pandemic in most hotels).",8.0,September 2021,"September 20, 2021",Deluxe King Room,1,Solo traveler,9,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0004887760838912181

This hotel served as our base in Madrid. It’s location. security and comfort helped us to have a wonderful time in beaut,Our visit was during the month of April. Weather ranged between cold rainy days and hot humid days. The hotel has every room with heater system and no other option. We had to open the window during most nights. The staff explained they could do nothing to improve the situation.,"The hotel has an excellent location. It is walking distance to numerous restaurants and shops. Close to the Plaza Mayor and many historic sites. The rooms are spacious and have confortable beds, closets and bathrooms. Their buffet breakfast is awesome!!!!

"Great facilities, few rude staff members, room availability should be clearly mentioned at booking.",We booked a king-size deluxe room for our entire stay but were given a double-twin room for the first night. The reception staff was rude and said that the entire hotel was booked and just 2 rooms are left - one double-twin bed room and 1 king-size bed room meant for handicapped individuals. It was a pain to talk with that person. We had to ask for the manager. The manager told us that they would move us to the better king-size bed room the next day. All this experience left a very bad-taste for us.,"Few staff members were very nice. The second room given to us (after request for 2nd night) was very good.

"Wonderful hotel, would definitly stay there again.","There are a couple of lounges for drinks and snack but we were told there wasn't a restaurant, so we had to walk around for a bit to find a place for dinner. We were a bit tired and really didn't want to go searching for a place to eat, and Air Europa never put our bags on our flight from Malaga so walking around in dingy clothes wasn't fun.

The only other thing that bothered me was the light in the bathroom that turns on automatically when you walk in, it turns off after a short time and you have to make a movement or wave hour hand around for it to come back on. While trying to brush my teeth the light had to be re-triggered multiple times. Maybe I was doing something wrong?  

I still rate the hotel as exceptional.","We liked almost everything about this hotel, it's a beautiful place with wonderful staff, a clean spacious room and and modern amenities.

Connecting to th WiFi was also a nightmare at the begginiging until we realised we needed to change the password that we were provided with.
In terms of decoration, it was really simple. 
The fridge was empty (not even water for an hotel that category) , although it they provided coffee and tea with a kettle in the room (as described), which kind of compensates a bit.

Madrid is a great city break stay and a good stay at the Rui.,As above the window feature between bathroom/bedroom wasn't a practical idea,"breakfast was good for vegetarian - plenty of fruit, breads, cereal, nut seeds and soya milk.  No hot options for veggies
Location was very good and staff really helpful at the front desk for questions.  We also went to a great flemenco show nearby and found a close by vegan restaurant (Vega) which was really good. The Palace was really close too and well worth seeing. We had a double terrace room which was a good size, however we weren't keen on the frosted window and door separating the bathroom/bedroom as it meant the bedroom was lit up every time one used the toilet in the night.   There was however a very useful bathroom light that had an auto sensor so it came on when you approached, but of course it meant the bedroom was lit up for a bit too long in there middle of the night.  Otherwise good room and great stay.

"Very nice hotel, but be aware of the construction in Plaza España","There was no air conditioning, and our room had southwest exposure and became very warm in the afternoon. We could open the windows, but there's a massive construction project in Plaza España. Jack hammer noise from 8 am to 8 pm. Also the motion sensor light in the bathroom was very annoying, set much too short (about 8 seconds). I asked them to adjust it, which they did, but it still popped on and off repeatedly for even short visits to the bathroom. I'd also appreciate it if they reduced the hot water temperature, they could save money and conserve energy, no one needs it that hot.","Very comfortable bed, large room with nice view, great breakfast buffet.

Great choice for a Madrid break - would recommend,The beds could definitely have been better given the standard of everything else.

Although busy, staff were friendly, efficient, polite and queues moved quickly. The location was ideal for all aspects of central Madrid. All forms of transport were easily accessible and walking was easy. This is the heart of the theatre and shopping district so go with empty suitcases! Pool on roof was not large but adequate. It got very busy as expected in the afternoon but there are additional sunbathing areas and enough space. Hotel bar prices were reasonable, focused in drinks only.

Great hotel and location. All positive.,"Rooftop bar was fantastic however the service up there was a bit haphazard, taking orders, dropping drinks, taking payment was all done
separately x 3 people , you had to wait to order at the table however it was a long wait as not many members of staff could take an order and the ones that could seemed to be slow and chatty elsewhere so it might take asking 4 passing staff to actually get 1 to come and take the order.

Pleasant,"The bathroom was stupidly and unnecessarily hateful. The bathroom's door was just a piece of glass, which didn't offer any kind of noise privacy. In addition, the bathroom light worked with movement. So, when one goes to the bathroom at night, the other one has to wake up and follow. Totally ridiculous. What is this architectural fashion?
There was also water pipe noise and other kind of noises at night. 
The bed was fine per se, but I was not comfortable with the old fashion blanket with sheets covering and tucking in the bed. I would prefer a duvet with a proper cover.

Everything you need for a great stay.,"The breakfast food range whilst good lacked a bit in the fruit, vegetable and pastry range but all in all, it was good.

The pool was a bit of a disappointment in that it was so small. No atmosphere.","Breakfast was good and extremely well organised. This catered for the very big crowds that were expected through. The breakfast staff worked like a well oiled machine and need to be commended for a fabulous effort. 
The reception staff were also great and managed the busy crowds as they came on through.

"Almost a perfect hotel, only the airconditioning was bad!","Heating vs airconditioning. The hotel has a heating/airconditioning system that only one of the 2 is working. At the end of May(?) the hotel switches the heating for the whole hotel to airconditioning. We were there in april and for me as a North-European it was hot in the room (25 degrees Celsius, the sun was heating the room for a long time). But then you cannot switch to airconditioning. It was not clear on the Booking.com site, otherwise I certainly did not choose this hotel, even the rest of the hotel is superb. I heard more North-European people complaint about this.

The waitress seemed to be starting in the position and her service was not up to standards, which is unusual in Spain where the service is always exceptional.  The manager was around and, as expected, was a professional.  Well, it doesn't really matter because everyone has a first day in the job...","The breakfast was very good, as usual in this type of hotel.

Exceptional,"The overall experience was good and I would come back again. We didn't spent a lot of time in the hotel as we used our short stay to visit beautiful Madrid. No negative experiences, the only part I would improve is they use too much paper packaging for the room service. One evening we ordered room service (the food was good, so it was worth it, especially with tired and hungry kids), but it came all packed in paper boxes and single use plastic cutlery. And even if it was compostable, it still looked like a lot of garbage being produced. I understand they have to make it eficient, but I personally prefer the classical room service, with usual plates and cutlery.","For the kids it was a great experience, as our room was at the 18th floor, but not with a front view so it was not the best view you could get (it was still nice). They also were happy with the breakfast buffet (which was varied and reminded them of Disneyland) and loved the Sky bar view. For the adults it was at par with other 4 stars locations.

Also having access via lifts, to visit a family member say from an 18th floor to 12th floor at their rooms.","Location was fantastic.

The repeated inquiries from staff on each floor can become bothersome, though it seems to be a flaw in the property’s design rather than the fault of the personnel.","Overall, the Riu Plaza España offers a superb location, immaculate decor, and a commendable staff.

it was completely ruined by the way I was treated in the hotel.,"I was unlucky with the quality of service.
I believe the hotel of that standard should be more attentive to and caring about their guests and the guests needs. But I was not treated well.
First of all, I booked this hotel solely for the rooftop bar and swimming pool and 360 terrace, to enjoy the last day of my stay in Madrid. 
The swimming pool bar was not working, and there was no prior notification when I was booking, otherwise I would have booked smith else. I had to bring a drink with myself upstairs so I could relax and read my book, and maybe have a dip. 
The person who hand offs the towels in the swimming pool told me that the glass is not permitted. When I asked her what to do, she said she will call her colleague to bring me a plastic cup instead.
Instead, they called a security person. It was so intimidating, I could not believe what was happening and how I was treated. In the end, I was so upset that I cried the rest of the evening sitting in my room. The last night in Madrid, instead of enjoying myself on the 360 rooftop I was crying in the hotel room. 
Guests should not be treated this way. I would expect smith like that from 2-3 star hotel. But from 4 star expensive worldwide chain hotel where room per night costs £250-320 - that is not acceptable. I would never stay in this hotel chain again, and neither of my friends and family.
Also, when the next day I wanted to go to the 360 terrace to enjoy the last views of Madrid, it was closed. Nothing informing about it prior. And was not only myself, there were quite a few other people.
The only reason I chose this hotel is for the swimming pool and the terrace - but I haven't got either - frustrating.","The hotel is aiming for the luxury vibe - so that was quite close. My room was large and clean and had a beautiful view on to the plaza. 
The breakfast buffet was amazing.
But on the other hand, the doors have no sound isolation - so when the cleaning staff starts cleaning in the morning - you literally can hear everything.",2.0,September 2022,"September 29, 2022",Deluxe Twin,1,Solo traveler,9,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.0004326718075214112

Great stay in the center of Madrid,In general staff at reception could give more information on parking around madrid with the restrictions of cars in the center they were lost in giving us information. Elevators take an eternity given the large quantity of people heading to the rooftop so the flow is not good.

Good apart from the top floor bars.,"The only problem with this hotel are the top level bars with views over the city. The staff are obviously tasked with getting as many non residents into these bars as possible.
This results in chaos, as residents, we went to the upper floor bar to watch the football final only to be told we could not go in as it was full, which it clearly was not.
Only after making a fuss and asking to see the manager did a table miraculously become available.
Not good enough when I am paying to actually stay in the hotel.
For this reason alone I would not go back. There are many hotels in madrid that treat their guests with more respect than the bar staff in yhe viewing bar here.

The room temperature was around 25 celsius degrees at night, and when we attempted to activate the air conditioning, it wasn't working. We asked for assistance from the staff, who informed us that the air conditioning is deactivated during the fall season. Their recommendation was to open the window; however, we encountered a limitation as the window could only be opened approximately 5cm due to some kind of lock mechanism attached to it.","The breakfast was truly exceptional, undoubtedly one of the locations with the best options I've ever encountered. They have an entire floor dedicated to a wide range of choices, from fruits and vegetables to sausages, eggs, desserts, and more.

This hotel likely boasts one of the best locations in the city, being conveniently close to everything and featuring a metro station right at its doorstep. This means you can easily reach any part of the city in no time.

It was a frustraded experience,"breakfast: at 7 am a lot of people waitin for the breakfast, very crowded. There are options but if you want a cake, there isn't, if you want a cookies, there aren't cookies, the food repeat a lot.

room: doble room in a small space, impossible to open my lugages. The bathroom very small for two people mantain your things for 5 days.

Elevators: fullllllll, long time waiting , a disaster, I needed time to arrive in the reception

Service: men in the recetion aren't polite , when you arrive they asked : where are you coming ? I 'm here , I `m in the hotel, and after my answer, ok. But there are a lot of people go in and go out in the hotel, dificult to control.

I waited to arrive in the room and find a chocolate, confortable shoes or something "" tender"" for the guests but no. Riu is very famous, I was frustrade.

Could have been so much better!,"Some of the staff were unpleasant and rude, which unfortunately left our group feeling very disappointed with our stay. Housekeeping were lovely, always greeted you with a smile, as were the staff in the restaurant for breakfast along with the porters storing the luggage. They were probably the nicest. 
Unfortunately the bar manager in the Sky Bar, some of the bar staff and the manager in the lobby bar were vile and rude. In the Sky Bar, she stood staring at us until we had finished our drinks, despite it being another 30 minutes until the bar closed. In my opinion we were having a great time, giggling and chatting, but not being obnoxious so the response was ridiculous. When we left she then appeared at the lifts and waited until we got in. I’m not sure what she thought we were going to do. We are a group of women in our 40s! 
The following day on departure we sat in the lobby bar with a few drinks and snacks from the bar. My friend grabbed a bag of crisps out of her bag to eat and the manager shouted no and pointed! A simple oh sorry you can’t eat your own food in here would have been sufficient. Being spoken to like naughty children was not the parting memory we wanted! 
I wouldn’t stay here again, which is a real shame as as the hotel is lovely but the staff need some training in manners and attitude.","The location was fantastic and the faculties were great, such as the pool, rooftop bar and restaurant (breakfast)",5.0,June 2023,"July 8, 2023",Deluxe Twin,2,Group,9,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0.0004104946221226566

Pleasant,"Some few cases excluded, this hotel has a serious problem with staff: they really struggle with English (unacceptable in a city like Madrid and in a structure like this one) and there has been some episodes really unacceptable. We booked 4 rooms, when we arrive in the morning they told us that just one room was ready (totally fine). We decided to go to the rooftop to meet other 2 people who where in Madrid but non staying with us. There can be just one guest per room, the other guy needed to pay to access the rooftop even if we told them that we were waiting for other 3 rooms (already completely payed btw). Next evening we went back there with the same 2 people (and with 4 rooms), they unpolitely told us we cannot go up, we argue and just after our resistance an other guy arrived and let us enter. When we reached the bar they told us no table service was done, we ordered to drink anyway and got our beverages to our table one by one (meanwhile at least 5 waitresses were placidly looking at us), then after 10 minutes one of them came to tell that we had 20 minutes to finish because they were closing.

2.Hotel is big - so felt a bit impersonal but nothing wrong with that .
3. We aren’t disabled but we’re given a disabled room . The toilet flush didn’t reach the front of the bowl so didn’t remove any debris which is a bit of a design flaw.
4. Finally and most annoyingly ( we did ring and mention this) we forgot to put a bag of change which we use for tips for the staff in the safe and this was removed on the second to last day we were there .

"Recommendable luxury hotel with good beds, very nice staff","The outside pool was closed on day 2. We choose this hotel because of the outside pool. Specifically because we were here only the weekend with knowing it is very hot in Madrid in summer. We planned our afternoon to be at the pool. When we arrived it was closed for a private event or something. No warnings upon booking, no warnings that day or what so ever. 
The first day the pool was open (they could have put a sign there to inform the guests maybe?) but the drinks at the pool are seriously overpriced and not good. The bar tender had no idea how to make our cocktails (was checking some notes the whole time) and the sangria was not good. He started to make the Sangria with Amaretto.","Breakfast is awesome , location is awesome and the 360degrees rooftop bar is so amazing.

Great for the rooftop bar experience,"The pool has great views and it is on top of a part of the building - therefore it is understandable that the space is limited.

The breakfast was comprehensive - lots of choices including hot breakfast. It was only here that we appreciated the full size of the hotel. It's huge but the service and atmosphere did not suffer because of that.
The hotel has an excellent rooftop terrace and bar on 27th floor - much higher than many other buildings around the plaza. This is open to the public. There is a decent tapas-style restaurant on 26th floor. We found this a bit more expensive compared to other restaurants in Madrid. 
There is a metro stop about 50 metres from the hotel. The hop-on-hop off bus stops right outside every 15 mins and the 001 free bus to Atcoha station goes from the other side of the road. It's about 10 mins walk to the Palace but we seemed to be able to get to most places on foot within 30 mins.

On my birthday the hotel made no effort on it’s own to recognize my birthday;
-The swimming pool is more like an ice cold water bath. It’s definitely not for swimming anyway;
The fitness area is too small and has limited options for the amount of guests the hotel receives;
-Room 1044 does not have a nice view. 
-Guests are continuously asked to sanitize their hands with alcohol, which is bad for you health, while you can easily wash your hands with soap and water nearby, which is more safe and clean. In the meanwhile the staff lays downs the cutlery and cleans the tables with their bare hands(?);

"The hotel has a great location, but falls short in other important aspects.","Despite being situated on the 16th floor, we could still hear a significant amount of noise from the lively area surrounding the hotel through the windows, as well as noise from the corridor and other rooms nearby. There was no coffee machine in the room, instead, we found a tea maker and some instant coffee, which was unexpected for a hotel of this caliber. While the breakfast was decent, it did not meet our high expectations. For example the traditional Spanish ham (Jamón) served was below our expectations and of lower quality compared to other 4-star hotels we've visited;  When I called the reception to request a tea spoon, I was informed that there would be an additional charge if it were to be brought to the room. Lastly, the mini-bar was completely empty, offering no items.","The hotel sits in a great location, within walking distance of many tourist attractions such as the Royal Palace (Palacio Real) and the iconic Gran Via, filled with shops, theaters, and cinemas. The room was very nice and spacious, offering a lovely view of Plaza España square and a partial view of Gran Via, however, for this we had to upgrade at the reception for an additional fee. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was very clean. We also appreciated the complimentary water bottle provided daily.

High and Lows,"Stayed for one night and chose this hotel due to the swimming pool, very convenient with 35ºC in Summer. However, as soon as we arrived they told us that the swimming pool was only available until 3 pm (when the checkin was expected to be done at 3pm).

Another not-very intelligent thing is that the bathroom has a strong automatic light and a glass door next to the bed.

"The nicest, friendliest staff is at RIU España","I had two reservations. My first reservation was 2 rooms, 616 and 1118. Room 1118 was great, beautiful. My adult children got that room. My husband and I got stuck in room 616, which I think is the worst room in the hotel. The window wasn’t really a window and opened to the roof. But you couldn’t see out the window. My husband and I felt like we were in a submarine. Also, I don’t know what’s above that room but it was constantly noisy even very very early in the morning. It sounded like carts were being rolled above our heads. It was awful. I even paid for an extra night because we were getting there early June 18th but I paid for June 17th because I wanted the room right away on the 18th because we landed at 8:00 in the morning. So I feel like I was ripped off and got the worst room. However, last 2 nights we stayed in room 1028, family room, that was beautiful and awesome.","The breakfast was awesome! The concierge members, especially Paulino, Pablo and Isabella were awesome. The checkin staff was great, friendly helpful. The doormen/security were friendly and awesome, nice.

Great start for our tour of Spain.,"Each night our air conditioning got a little loader, if we had stayed longer, we would have asked for a different room.

Great choice if you want to visit Madrid for several days.,"1. The soundproof seems a bit poor. In my first stay, I heard noises not sure whether it is due to high guests traffic or close to the elevators. 
2. The parking garage is too difficult for a larger size car. My car is just a medium size SUV but still very difficult to manuver. I had to ask my wife watch and give notice in every turn. I recommend hotel give notice to guest in advance and recommend they park the car in the garage under Spanish square and give direction (drive route map) to them about the entrance of the garage.",The people are very nice and responsive. I like their direct attitude and treat my issue sincerely. The location is also great. Both easy for sightseeing and for trip to nearby towns. The rooftop bar is a plus with the great view.

Hotel has some limitations,"This hotel is massive and was packed to the rafters - over 1,000 guests - so (functional) breakfast was like a conveyor belt. Lacked any atmosphere. Food ok. Difficult to get any help from staff as they seemed very stretched - although always super polite. 
The rooftop ‘swimming pool’ is a joke. It’s a paddling pool stuffed to the gills with kids. With families cramped around. We jumped on the metro to the public open air pools in casa del campo - a necessity in 40 degree heat! They were spacious, spotlessly clean and a couple of euros for the day. There was a quieter roof top sun deck at the Riu which was virtually empty. 
The bar on the sky deck was one to avoid. Pounding music and stuffed with people. 
Will def come back to stay at Riu as a great base for Madrid",Location fantastic - premium room on 20th floor was incredible with stunning views over the city.

"Great hotel, dreadful location of room.","During our stay there were two events. 
1st event was on a Saturday, a wedding reception with a live band and a DJ. When we asked at reception when it was going to finish we were told 10pm as they would be going down to the 4th floor. The music didn’t stop till 00.30 then the noise from the kitchen staff started and went on for another hour.
The 2nd event was on a Tuesday. We noticed banners going up and the door to the terrace was locked with a sign saying a private event was going to take place that evening. We went to reception and asked when this was going to finish. No one seemed to know the answer to that question. However, there was no music and was pretty quiet until it finished with people shouting whilst leaving the event. Needless to say this went on late and then the kitchen staff started the clear up until 4am. Trolleys being pushed along staff talking loudly and shouting. Chairs and tables dragged along. Doors banging. A trolley crashed into our door and that’s when I shouted at them and my wife actually got up and reminded them there were guests in the room. 
Even in the days of no events we were woken up at regular intervals throughout the night by service staff banging doors and then the morning cleaning staff talking loudly.
Be warned! NO TO ROOM 2122, in our opinion it should not be sold as guest accommodation.","The hotel is great, the bars are very nice, the staff are lovely BUT the room we were given, 2122, for our 5 nights stay was/is opposite a roof terrace and next door to the service area for the cleaners and the service kitchen for events on the 21st floor.",3.0,June 2022,"June 28, 2022",Deluxe King Room,5,Couple,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0003437552546779424

Lovely hotel,"It was my husband's birthday on the 18th. We returned to the hotel after dining out. We went to the rooftop bar for a last drink before going to sleep. My husband speaks Spanish as do I. He asked a waitress if we could order a drink. It was 00:20hrs. She was very rude to us and said in an abrupt manner I don't know if you can, I'll ask. She went to the bar and didn't speak to anyone. She had no intention of serving us. We asked another lady if we could order a drink and she was very polite and helpful and took our order. We stayed until 01:00hrs when the bar closed and the first waitress avoided us altogether. Her attitude was very poor. She even told us that she didn't want to be here and wanted to return to Bolivia. Telling us something so personal was very unprofessional, in my opinion, especially as we only asked for a drink. 
We missed breakfast as it is very early and we didn't know if you had room service. The coffee in the room was awful.","The bed was very comfortable.

Terrible room!!!,"The room was tiny and did not have any view at all. Someone tried to play with our save , please be very careful about leaving something valuable in your room, three nights for new years eve, locked in a very tiny room with small windows, overpriced for nothing.

The food on the rooftop is terrible, and one lady at the reception in the night was very rude to us, when we tried to go to the rooftop for a drink. She made us wait while people where going in without her permission, I wonder why she stops me and my partner outside.

They say there is no reservation for the sky bar and the rooftop; however, you can see notes at the tables that are “reserved” I guess they expect tips. 
What actually disappointed us was that someone tried to open our save.

Politely suggest you view your room before paying for it !!! Can be good but `can`  be sub-optimal,"Paid extra for room with a view which I received on a previous stay 6 days previously no problems (lovely double aspect room on 16th floor fantastic views) - however on this stay despite booking exactly the same room class  and paying exactly the same  rate as my previous booking and a booking confirmation clearly stating a room with a view, I was allocated a dingy dank room on the 6th floor with no natural light  and totally opaque glassed windows which on opening revealed a scenic vista of a brick wall and an exhaust vent flu for the kitchen - on very politely informing the hotel of the error of their ways (I am very much an English gentleman not a descamisados Britanicos) I was told by the female receptionist after doing some air typing in a `computer says no` stylee that there was nothing they could do . Having paid for my room before seeing it and it was late in the afternoon, there was not a lot I could do either except an objective posting of my room view photos on t`internet..  My exact same `issue` appears multiple times on multiple hotel review sites so this is not Ranty McRantface with  a subjective issue as to a mis-perceived verbal slight but the non provision of service objectively stated in writing.

Disappointing,"First of, I asked for a king size bed and for the first time in many years using Booking.com, they told me they could not honor my request and gave me 2 twins ( which I strongly refused).
The room I was in was extremely small and dark, the decor is simply depressing as well as the hallways, I though I was inside The Shining film. 
The towels instead of dry, they scratch, cheap quality. The color and texture of the rug was awful, scratchy too. The blanket was dark grey and cheapest quality in the market.
How can I understand that a 4 star hotel doesn’t have a restaurant? Unheard of.
The staff uniform go according with the room decor, even the good looking employees look ugly , they look cheap and safari like, Madrid is not the Serengeti Savannah. 
They give you only one bottle of water for your entire stay, unheard of too. Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Never again, I will stay in a Riu hotel. You might serve other type of customers but, certainly not the American customer.","The hotel looks very nice from the outside and lobby.

an excellent hotel for a relaxing city break,"The pool wasn’t open. It was sunny and 26 degrees Celsius on average every day of our stay. I would have really liked the option to relax in the pool during my stay. The rooftop bar has amazing views but we never got the chance to sit down and have drinks in it, while the hotel say that they cater for hotel guests first this does not guarantee you a seat and there doesn’t seem to be an option for guests to reserve seats from what I noticed. it’s very busy with tourists queueing to take pictures and this is similar with the main entrance into the hotel. It didn’t bother me personally but it’s worth noting that people will hang around speaking to the door men asking questions about the rooftop bar even though there are clear signs stating they need to use a different entrance.","The property is situated in the heart of the city and is walking distance to the royal palace of Madrid, plaza de  mayor and  mercado de San Miguel. it’s a 40 minute train ride from the airport and once off the train the hotel is 80m away.

Never again,"Very disappointing stay at the hotel:
- The room had no chance to regulate temperature. The aircon was out of order. So I had to sleep in a room with 24-25 degree Celcius at any time. Staff told me that probably cooling is switched off during cold season. Window was only possible to open a crack. Due to the location of the room and with the very small window (looking to the rooms opposite), there was almost no daylight. Lamps were necessary day and night.
- The worst part of the hotel is the lousy, arrogant and unfriendly staff in the rooftop bar. We were a big group, staying for a conference in the hotel for almost a week. Bar closes at 1 am, even as dinner time in Madrid is usually very late. At 1 am straight you will be unfriendly kicked out of the bar, no matter if you are guest or whatever. I asked if this was a Country rule due to COVID or a RIU rule. The answer of the lady there was: This is a RIU rule, I completely agree with this rule and you have to comply. It is 8 min past 1, leave the bar.
- Room service at night does not exist. When kicked out of the bar there is no chance to get anything else from room service than water 

I never experienced any hotel at this level with a worse customer focus. Looks like as a customer you should be happy and thankful to get the opportunity to leave your money there.

Did Not Meet Expectations,"We had high expectations of this hotel given the reviews.  But unfortunately in our case these  were not met. After a grueling transatlantic flight and having undergone chemotherapy on the same day of the trip, I had asked my nephews (residents in Madrid whom I had not seen for a decade), to visit and have lunch with us at the RIU Hotel. Upon their arrival at the hotel entrance, they were treated disrespectfully by the manager, who insisted that they pay an entrance fee. How is it possible that a hotel guest is not allowed to receive visitors, especially when they come with the intention of consuming at the restaurant? Where is the consideration for a guest, having even explained to the guard that I (a hotel guest) am a cancer patient?

This experience generated deep dissatisfaction with the service provided by this hotel and its lack of empathy towards atypical or occasional difficult circumstances of its guests.

Separately the hotel’s rooftop bar, which apparently is quite famous in town, while very nice given the spectacular views, was packed full. The line of people waiting to enter was extremely long, surrounding the whole restaurant, making the experience too noisy and chaotic. The line should be outside the facility, not in there among the guests seated for dinner and aiming at enjoying a pleasurable evening.","Location, good sized room, very comfortable mattress.",3.0,April 2024,"April 15, 2024",Deluxe King Room,2,Couple,9,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0.00031833082990040043
"Amazing hotel, fantastic location- don't expect any service after 1pm on checkout day..","The only thing that let's this hotel down is the way you are treated once you have checked out.
We checked out at 11am but our flight home wasn't until late evening so we had planned to visit the Sky Bar and restaurant for our last dinner in Madrid- the perfect way to end a special weekend. 
However, we were told that after 1pm we would need to pay 10 euros each to visit and that we could only access via the door at the back.
I fully appreciate that this maybe the Rui's policy, however the concierge team made us feel very unwelcome which we feel was unacceptable given that we had spent £200 a night to stay and only that morning we were considered valued guests of the hotel.
We've never been made to feel this way and have always been able to use hotel facilities after check out when we have had a later flight home. This has made us reluctant to choose a Rui again in the future and we hope this policy will be reviewed as it seems unfair.",The location is amazing and the hotel itself is beautiful with fantastic facilities.,7.0,May 2023,"May 22, 2023",Deluxe King Room,3,Couple,9,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0.0003179726810817304

Not the best for a family with small kids.,"Not very family friendly with small kids. The hotel appeals a younger generation with their high selllng consumption of alcohol and too bars. The pool is small and cold even when it’s 27 degrees outside. I was advise I could leave our luggage after check out since we had a night flight but it was denied because they already had too many. We had to cancel all our activities that day and just head out to the airport with our luggage since we are a family of 4. Overall, I don’t I will ever stay in a RIU hotel as such because they customer service is very transactional for a hotel that has over 200 rooms.",Great location.,1.0,June 2024,"June 4, 2024",Deluxe Family King Room,3,Family,9,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0.00031489549277171117

Terrible management for the overbooking,"I arrived this hotel after midnight, was told that the hotel was overbooked and I should be relocated to another hotel about 400m away for the first night. (I had three nights booking) It was after midnight and I was a foreigner in Spain during busy season of big international conference, therefore there were no other options but to agree with their suggestion. They offered me a free taxi ride to the relocated hotel but it was after tremendously tiring 20hrs flight and I felt really terrible. They forced me to pay before relocation. The relocated hotel, was same 4 star hotel, however much smaller room with spotted towels, room quality was never comparable. I would have never chosen that hotel unless it was late night. I could not agree with the same payment for this hotel and the relocated one, also my times consumed for relocating, packing my luggage again and coming back during a busy business trip can never be compensated with just one free drink ticket and small chocolate box I turned down. I had a very hard time managing the situation and was deeply disappointed their worst management and apologies. i asked my first night should be refunded through booking.com service center, which was rejected by the hotel. 
I agree the room condition and breakfast of the hotel was good, and that's why I got more offended after coming back to this hotel as the facility of the rolocated first night was much poorer. The best hotel is not only about facilities.

Fair,"No restaurant, only tapas
Breakfasts way too crowded and noisy unless you eat early, but nights are late in Spain so no one wants to get up esrly for breakfast. And there is no ”no breakfast” option.
It is impossible to open a charge account and pay it up at the end of your stay, you can only open an account by paying in a sum in advance. Unusual and inconvenient. 
Generally the hotel has inconvenient routines regarding charges, I had to go down to the main desk and open an account by paying 20  € in order to be have my room phone ‘opened’ to make a local call.

Bad,"we were 3 guest so I booked a room for 4 people then a i realized that i putted the wrong dates so i cancelled mi booking and make the same reservation with the right dates in the same room. But in that moment i putted 2 guest instead of 3. I did not worry to much because in booking said that the price for 2/3/4 guest is the same and that room had capacity for 4. By the way i text a message to the hotel throught the booking app. Using the chat of my reservation. They did not respond.  I make a phone call and they no respond.

the problem was when i came to the hotel. i have to pay 125 euros (extra) because we were 3!!!! in a room of 4!!!
And i told the recepcionist that i booked for 3 and they i changed the booking(i told the situacion) And also insaid to her that the price in booking was the same for 2/3 or 4 they did not said nothing about paying and extra for a room. Even when the room is for 4 and we were 3!.

A really disaster. i felt cheated. i payed that! . And if booking can do something for me i will always use this app. But if not i guess i will never use this again. because this experience ruined my trip and cost me a lot of extra money that also make no sense",the staff was inneficient,1.0,February 2022,"March 2, 2022",Deluxe Family King Room,4,Solo traveler,9,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0002496296153563498

Beautiful hotel spoiled by the crowds on the rooftop bar,"One of the reasons I booked this hotel was because of the rooftop bar, however this is also the reason I would not return.  Don't get me wrong it is amazing however, each time we entered the hotel I felt like I had to prove I was a guest as the doorman asks people entering that are not guests and who wish to go to the rooftop bar to leave and go around the back of the hotel, to enter via a different lift. They are also charged to enter.  The result of this is not a pleasant experience, this makes it difficult to obtain a seat (and it wasn't even high season) and as you don't actually need to be there for any food or drink there are queues that wrap around the area for photo opportunities on the glass platform or even just wandering around looking at the views this makes you feel you are sitting in the middle of a tourist attraction. Not what I pay to go to a nice hotel to experience.","Hotel is beautiful, I have always loved this building even before it was a hotel.

the lovely restaurant supervisor ( Lucia?)accommodate a table for me and 
then I managed to go to the sky bar ( not the rooftop)
the sky bar closed at 1. Anyhow the experience was disappointing
