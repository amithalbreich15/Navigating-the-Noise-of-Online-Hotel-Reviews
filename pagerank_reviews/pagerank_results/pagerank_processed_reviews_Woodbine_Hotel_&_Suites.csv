"The facility was adequate, but shabby. Staff was mostly indifferent to us.","This hotel was meant to be high end when it was built, but has descended to shabbiness.  The hardscapes - tiles, counters, floors and lighting are all beautiful, but the maintenance of the surfaces has not been kept up.  There was mold in the caulking around the bathtub.  I found a finger or toenail clipping in the carpet near the bed (YUK!) I noticed that there were scuff marks and signs of wear and tear on the trims. The clerk who checked us in was indifferent to us, not friendly at all.  Breakfast was good, but I would have liked to have some fresh fruit.","The bed was very comfortable, and the linens and towels were very clean.  Breakfast was hot and delicious.

Still a pleasant stay all in all. I would come back again and probably . Still a good return .,"The toilet paper holder could have been attached to the wall instead of left on the shelf. I think someone forgot to repair it.
The room was a bit cramped. I think I will get a room with 2 double beds next time.
A suitcase stand would have been nice .","The breakfast was adequate. Would have preferred some form of protein like cheese or hard boiled eggs but in the Age of Covid difficult to assess clientele 's preferences.I

Read several bad reviews but we found the hotel meet are needs. Staff were always helpful.,"The pillows are lumpy or flat. Not very comfortable. We mentioned the tub edging was peeling off and appeared to have mold. Hopefully they fix this.
Room was damp when AC was not on. Too bad there is no fan in the bathroom. 
 The bacon at the breakfast buffet was never cooked enough. 
Every evening on our return to the hotel we had to get a new door key card. Never had this occur before with other hotels. The card key deactivated every 24 hours.

Disappointing,There were zero amenities. Their site said there was a pool but upon arrival there was not. There were few chanels to watch on the t.v and they stopped the shuttle buses that used to take you to the casino. Now you have to pay extra for a cab. It's very outdated. The rooms don't even a chair to sit on. And for a king bed they give 2 tiny pillows. The beds were hard and loud like they had rubber sheets or something.,The rooms were clean and the gave you water and hot breakfast. The eggs and hashbrowns were dry and over cooked but at least they gave a hot breakfast.

"Below Average, no internet speed","1) the black lady who handles breakfast need proper training how to behave with customers. One day she scolded me for taking coffee cup with orange juice but I did exactly what she said, that ""help yourself"" so for keeping it dust free, i chose the cup with lid
2) tv does not have any great channels, tv in my room had lines and sometimes it was noisy without good picture quality, sometimes suddenly ok. I will post the photo soon about tv.
3) cleaning ladies are very lazy to work or clean the room if you are staying inside in the room for longer time. They will keep gossiping if we ask some towel or water bottle to them showing some kind of princess attitude. They keep cleaning the room which is already cleaned.
4) No room service breakfast but we need to go out in one common place where everyday same breakfast like bread and butter, waffle or pancake.
Note: this is not the place if you are looking to work from hotel remotely. Internet speed is very very slow. I think it would be common for most hotels.","I stayed in the hotel for two weeks, 1 week own and second week with booking.com.

You get what you pay for!,"I had a bed bug, I don't blame anyone here. They can come from somewhere. Rooms were cleaned well. Just did not sleep well when I saw and killed the bug. I thought company would compensate for that but didn't seem to go anywhere. 

The bathroom did not drain well. So your feet are always in the dirty water. Took 5 minutes to drain for a 6 minute shower. But again, nobody will know that because they don't talk shower in that lol. Room 228, please fix it people! It's a good place.

Woodbine to downtown would take you close to 50 CAD on uber and almost an hour in the morning due to traffic. So rather that getting 140/room and spending 100 on Uber, just pay somewhere 200/night and spend less on transit, and remain sane!","Good location from the airport.

It was cheap but we paid the price...,"- The room smelled like cigarettes even though it was a non-smoker room. 
- The shower was badly designed (uneven tiles and water could exit the shower allowing water to run through the entire bathroom floor). 
- The toilet was not cleaned on our arrival (hair was found in the toilet bowl). 
- The pillows were very flat. 
- I was exhausted from my trip and when I asked an employee for an extra chair for my room, the employee told me to just grab one from the breakfast room and did not even try to get one for me. I had to come back a second time to ask them where that was and still did not offer to bring it to my room... 
- When I asked if they could hold onto our luggage after our checkout for a few hours the night before our check out, they told us they could; but the morning after, they changed their answer and said they couldn't hold onto our luggage because they had theft issues in the past...

Immediately I wrote a complaint through the app I booked (Booking.com) and they called the hotel and then at 1:20 am the guy made a call to my room trying to convince me he was a different guy and asking to not to talk to someone else because the guy who disrespected me could get into trouble and they could fire him.

Extremely unprofessional staffing at this location. If your looking for valuable staffing and hosting this is not the place!

The hotel itself is vintage and a bit spooky, but in that cool old hotel way.  When we entered our room we found it slightly strange that the blackout drapes were closed and the room was dark.  When we opened the blinds we realized that our rooms window did not look out to the outside, but instead overlooked the ballroom, as did the other rooms. This means of course without the blackout drapes you'd be risking sharing a bit too much with your neighbors.  Also gave off a bit more Shining vibes, but again not in the worst way.

UNPROFESSIONAL & Lack of Morales  Business,"PLEASE DO NOTCOME HERE IF YOU ARE PLANNING EARLY CHECK OUT FOR WHATEVER REASON. GOD FORBID THERES WM EMERGENCY! EXTREMELY UNORGANIZED & UNPROFESSIONAL PLACE

I booked for 3 days, which the policy includes partial refund & does not indicate about reservation being unrefundable or that you may not be able to modify. So I did an early check out after I spoke to front desk who said I would have to speak to Booking which I did the reservation through but gave me the go ahead I was able to leave. They did not indicate there about my refund not being unrefundable or an inability to recieve it.

Booking has tried to contact them for 3 days straight (emails & call) and they have not yet responded (completely unprofessional).

I’ve repeatedly called the front asking for them to resolve this and now I’m told that the manager will most likely tell me NO to a refund. 

Sounds like a lot of excuses and if the property had stated NO REFUNDS or NO MODIFICATIONS i would have understood & respected the policy but it does not absolutely state that anywhere for MY RESERVATION i chose.
