Very pleasant and great location,"Corridor dark and needs a lick of paint and perhaps new carpet. A lack of toilet facilities. only one in our dorm of 8. Only one shower but there are others dotted around the corridor. 
Roof top bar closes at midnight. 
You have to purchase everything. Ie towels, locks, left luggage. In other hostels I’ve stayed these things are either free or you leave a refundable deposit.",Helpful staff. Rooms clean. Shower works well. Fantastic location. Near the Metro. Roof top bar is cool. Good WIFI. Cafe on the ground/lower ground looks pleasant but I didn’t use it.

A great hostel in the centre of Madrid,"The shower room is absolutely TINY. Which is very frustrating when sharing with other people, you don't have the space to get dressed and the toilet is separate to the shower which is what I like but there's just generally no space for you to get dressed.","The hostel was very clean and our fellow room mates were very nice. The hostel has this really cool roof top bar and terrace which plays music and your able to grab a drink up until 11 during the week and 1am on the weekends. The staff at Reception on arrival were very nice and the location is absolutely amazing when it comes to getting around the city. 

I don't really stay in hostels if I'm honest but due to us booking accommodation really late I'm glad we stayed here for some of our trip. 

Would I stay here again yes, however was very happy to move to our apartment after 3 days as having personal space is pretty important to me and my friend.

Rooftop bar/jacuzzi/area closed so early I never could have a drink or swim there. But if you have time earlier maybe it's nice! Jacuzzi closes at 4pm if I remember right.

There were a lot of people working remotely (felt like an office) but music was super loud. a small problem for meetings with the noice.

Bathrooms and shower in the bedrooms. This was adverticed as a perk but imo it would be nicer for everyone if they were in a separate space.

"Friendly staff, comfortable but no air conditioning","Unfortunately, when we arrived the air conditioning was broken in the hostel. This and the very high temperatures made it rather uncomfortable. We were informed prior to check in and given the option to move hotels if we wanted to and offered a late check out. We were provided with temporary air conditioning system which was OK but not great.
The only other disappointment was that on our last night the terrace had been closed for the evening for a private event. We knew this was a possibility but were not informed until we arrived there for the evening. It would have been nice if there was something to let guests know it would be closed that evening so we could have made other arrangements for our night.",The property itself was very bright and looked great. It was very central and most things were within a 10-15 minute walk. We had booked a twin room with a private bathroom which was very comfortable. The shower was great in the room also which really helped with the heat and its pressure was lovely. The room was very clean and the common areas were very comfortable and clean also.

"Feels very corporate, for better or worse","The big complaint is, the doors were thin so you can hear what's happening in the hall constantly, but they also SLAM shut so hard that you can feel it when anyone within 20 m of your room comes or goes.

This is the most corporate-feeling hostel I've ever stayed at. It felt like the place was run by a board room a thousand kilometers away. Some examples

- Drinks on the rooftop bar were super pricey (6 euro for a bottle of Alhambra beer, which I saw at a fancy restaurant the next day for 4.5 euro) - I was up there one night and it was totally dead, though I saw a few groups go up to the bar and then leave without buying anything. The next night was lively, but they had half the rooftop blocked off for a private event that guests were not allowed in.

- They charge 5 euro (charge, not deposit) to rent a towel, and it's another 5 euro if you want to swap it out for a fresh one.

- In the private rooms, there is no chest or drawers to organize your clothes, and the bathroom light is on a 5 minute timer (so it will turn off while you're in the shower unless you stick your hand out and wave). 

All kinds of little things like that which tell you as a guest ""we don't want to spend any more money to make you comfortable than is absolutely necessary, and we will extract as much cash from you as we can while you're here""","Great location, right in the heart of the city.

Overall - A modern and clean hostel in a great location!,"The only things I would comment on are that in my room the air conditioning either didn't work or wasn't very powerful. I did try to shut the window again but it didn't seem to change. I could have mentioned it to reception but I wasn't staying for long. 
I had a top bunk bed and the main room light was right above my bed (it was very bright) so it woke me up a few times early in the morning when other people got up at like 7am. But that can't be helped - I would just recommend an eye mask!

Also the shower drain had a strong smell of sulphur at times but it wasn't unbearable.

These are just minor issues though.","The location was excellent, only a minute walk away from Gran Via (main street with shops and theatres etc.). The room was very clean and modern. The beds have a little shelf, USB and power sockets and a light. The security was good too because the lifts in the hostel would only work for people with a keycard.

Pleasant,"There was A LOT of noise from the street, as some restaurants and bars were emptying their trash (bottles included) in the middle of the night. Since the air conditioning was not turned on, I could not close the window.
One of the reasons I booked this hostel was the Jacuzzis at the Terrace. There was no information anywhere in the Website that they are only available from June.
I was hoping to spend some relaxing time at the Terrace at times of less activity at the bar. I was told (by a very unfriendly staff) that I wasn’t allowed to stay there if I was not consuming. It seems not to be fair, since I was already paying for staying there. If I wanted to consume at a Terrace I could just go anywhere else, instead of staying at the Hostel’s Terrace.","All bathrooms, showers and bedroom very clean.

This place made our Madrid trip truly special!,"We did encounter a minor issue when we arrived around 23:00 with only one key instead of two. Unfortunately, the security personnel's response was less than welcoming, treating us with suspicion and rudeness, as though we had ulterior motives for entering the building unlawfully due to our single pass. We were unaware of the two-pass policy prior to this incident.

A suggestion for the security team would be to maintain a friendly demeanor initially and then address any concerns or policy breaches.","We absolutely loved our stay at this hotel/hostel.

Only 1 USB was functional.
Mattress were smaller than the bed, very uncomfortable. Mattress covers were smaller that the mattress fitting very tightly and making very easy to pop out.
There where 2 bed that could be fold against the wall but customers were not allowed to do it so forget to gain extra room space while you are awake.

The most uncomfortable experience in Europe!,"The air conditioning has been broken for weeks. We stayed here for 1 night about 2 weeks ago when it was already broken and then cane back here again about 2 weeks later and it was still broken.

They put these useless portable fans in the room that just move 40 degree heat around. We complained and all the manager said is if you dont like it you can cancel and go somewhere else.  We specifically booked with aircon cos you obviously need it when it's this hot. The management wouldn't give us a discount even though we had paid for air con rooms. They were unhelpful and unfriendly.  For us to have to move to another hotel was just too difficult so we stayed but at no point was any effort made to compensate us for a horrible experience.

"Chic, hip, and spotlessly clean; cloud-soft beds and thoughtful design","There were signs around the dining area that it was only for the use of paying customers, no outside food allowed. Does the hostel really want to force us to eat in the bedrooms? And this is a hostel, it's budget--most hostels include a kitchen so people can prepare their own meals, that's an assumption of most hostels, that you're preparing your own meals and probably eating cheaply. I'm also not a fan of en suite bathrooms in dorm bedrooms, it's a bit gross to me, but to their credit Generator keeps everything spotless and that's really the only way it's okay. Also, you have to bring your own lock for the lockers, so heads up.","The place is very chic, very cool, and well-run. Professional, friendly, helpful staff and--most importantly for any hostel--the place is always SPOTLESS. The bedrooms were really well-designed. As someone who stays at a lot of hostels, I know what works, what doesn't, and what's essential, and whoever designed Generator understood all of this. The individual lockers, which slide away neatly under the beds for storage, are capacious and include a hanger; there are hooks on the wall for towels and clothes; the showers have hooks and stools for putting your towel etc. (it seems basic, but it's amazing how many hostels lack these!). Each bed has an outlet, reading lamp, and a shelf and pocket for storage of personal items. The bedroom is painted a dark color and features blackout blinds so it's really conducive to a good sleep. The beds, pillows, and duvets were like clouds. It was pure joy to lie back on them after a long day out in the city. The showers have super nice shower heads. The lounge is hip, a good place to meet people, and always has great music playing on the speakers. There's also a rooftop bar with a great DJ, which is all cool in theory.

horrible place,"the staff and cleanliness were terrible. overpriced food. no access to the facilities promoted online. Terrible place and horrible vibes, the staff is far beyond rude and hostile. The jacuzzi, the main reason I booked this place,  was closed because they said in a Very Rude manner that they were examining a germ problem the water had and had no idea when it would be fixed. you cannot access the terrace unless you buy something from their overpriced menu. You cannot even sit in any of the ¨common¨ areas downstairs unless you pay for the crappy overpriced food. As someone who works remotely, I found it very annoying. plus it was filthy, in a 7 day stay, the bathroom and bedroom floor never got cleaned. 

The main issue, in the end, was the horrible way the staff spoke to their guests. I have never been treated in such a rude manner by a whole staff team, especially the woman, 
everyone else was highly aggressive, and one of the girls literally shouted at me, to the point where I had to ask for her to moderate her voice since she was being so rude.
I wanted to leave honestly, but they have a no-refund policy, so I had to stay there or lose my money. 

They don´t offer the most minimal essentials like a towel, which you have to rent for 5 euros, and the security was terrible, there was a drugged-up guy wandering the halls of my floor from 3 am till 7 am, we were all scared to even go out, he was trying to get into our room even, and the staff did nothing about it.",the location is the only good thing about this place,1.0,May 2023,"May 17, 2023",Bed in 8-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,1,Solo traveler,8.1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0.0010334372284593544

Good infrastructure but terrible policies - unpleasant experience,"- Forbidden to bring food to anywhere in the hotel, including in the common areas! For example, for breakfast you have to take the optional breakfast for 7-10€ (which is not available after 11am) or go outside. This rule is enforced by the staff, as a result I've seen guests hiding in the dorm rooms, eating sit on the floor! And of course there is nowhere to boil water, let alone cook anything.
- Checkout is at 10am. You can extend it to 1pm for 5€. Should be: standard 12pm, extendable to 3pm.
- You can't leave your luggage for free after checkout. You need to pay for expensive automated lockers. Surprise: standard cabin luggage doesn't fit in the small ones.

Good,"What I didn't like was is has no kitchen to cook either warm up any food and the worse part, the aircon didn't work. I was there in middle of june, in the middle of a heath wave and it was awful! I can understand one day could be off, but I stayed 5 days and it wasn't fixed and also, talking to a girl who was there 2 weeks before, had the same problems with the aircon.
And one more thing I was disappointed with it was with the jacuzzi. I saw it always covered and once, I saw that it was opened from 11am till 5pm, more or less. Usually when we travel, we spend the day doing sightseeing and relax in the evening... So, if you have a restricted service, you must be let us know on the description .
And the last thing I didn't like was, there is a terrace upstairs, with a bar and ad I was there around 7pm, sitting on a chair, talking to the phone, because the room was bloody hot, I was ""invited "" to leave the terrace because I wasn't drinking anything from the bar.

Then just here’s your key - no introduction to place or surrounds.

the ac was very poor and I was there in a cooler night. outside temp was like 19*C but our room was a hot box we were sweating. when u open the windows all the sounds come in so you had to pick heat or noise - not a lot of sleep.

It was an apropos metropolitan hostel lodging experience following 47 successive nights as a Camino de Santiago certifie,The lack of clarity if there were any times of the day that it was OK to bring one’s own food into the dining area adjacent to the lounge area that was part of the communal space in Planta -1.  The lounge didn’t really have any tabletop space appropriate for laying out one’s food.,"I have been in Spain as an American Pilgrim on the Camino (Francés) de Santiago for 50 days and 50 nights starting on April 4, 2024. After initially staying 2 nights at a BnB in Madrid and the following night at a nice hotel in Pamplona, I stayed the remaining 47 nights in albergues, monasteries, hostels,  and finally the mega-hostel Generator Madrid for 2 nights.

All of these communal accommodations win my heart hands down with no comparison to the standard luxury hotel. The metropolitan atmosphere and sheer size of Generator Madrid (> 500 beds) does not diminish the underlying hospitality that was at the core of nearly all of the Camino albergues.

Note that the medieval pilgrims were largely provided lodging, food, and care by monasteries initially, and then also by community buildings called “Hospitales” in Spanish. I would not be surprised if the English word “hospitality” is derived from these Old World albergues that were called Hospitales. The main attendant at an albergue is called an “Hospitalero.”

At Generator Madrid, the service has been excellent. I arrived for check-in at 1 AM after 6-1/2 hours of bus and then high-speed train travel from Finisterre to Santiago to Madrid. The 24/7 reception desk was attended by a bilingual receptionist, Jesús, who was muy amable y animado, even at 2 AM.

I was the last guest to leave my 8-bed dormitory room at 10:15 AM, and the cafeteria staff, Rushyl and Jiana, were very welcoming, and did not rush me as I did not arrive for breakfast until 10:45 AM. Breakfast service ends at 11 AM.

Depressing room,"The room is very very dark. We couldn't even see if there is a day or night outside. The window view is to another room, which means you have no privacy at all if you wish to open the window. On top of it all, the room is paint with dark colors, so everything feels even darker and depressing. 
I want to add that we were very disappointed from the terraza (rooftop), which was one of the reasons we chose this hostel. During the week it was empty and no one was sitting there, and on thursday when we came to sit, they told us all the seats are reserved and let us to sit only at the corner. Finally we preferred to go to another place. I wish we were updated before that reservation is needed.

No compensation whatsoever as well, not that I was expecting any but combined with the described above, this got me frustrated.

On the one day that we needed to use the car to get to Parque Warner, there was a pre-planned construction invention happening in the parking, which we were not told about and no warning anywhere, and reception told us WE COULD NOT REMOVE OUR CAR. We had to BEG the construction crew to remove some stuff so we could get out. Almost lost our tickets and ruined our vacation.

On a second occasion, to warm up baby food after 7pm, the receptionist told us to come to her, and she would use the microwave in the kitchen closed at that time. We did and everything was good, a second receptionist did the same, but the third receptionist refused to do it, even after I told him the whole situation. He made me go up to the rooftop bar looking for some cook that wasn't there, and when I came back down to ask him a second time, he did it instantly, which lets me know he could always could have done it, he just didn't want to and help me.","Great location, right next to Gran Via.

Wouldn’t recommend at all.,"The staff, with the exception of one or two people from the bar, are really not good at working in a hospitality business. They were unfriendly and didn’t look like they wanted to be there at all. I normally ask for hot water to drink mate and even that was an issue at this place.

The A/C was broken for my entire two week stay, in the summer, in Madrid. They would inform you when you arrived, and by that time it’s hard to change your accommodation specially if you’re in a relatively long stay like me. They said they would have it fixed by the middle of that week. I left two weeks later and it was still broken.

Every time I tried to go to the terrace, an unfriendly guy would inform me that they either didn’t have any more food or free tables.","The location is amazing, out of that, I’m struggling to think about other positive aspects.",4.0,July 2022,"July 4, 2022",Bed in 4-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,14,Solo traveler,8.1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0.00080893357629868

I had a conference call and wanted to sit away from the music. He forced me to sit at the bar because I was on my own. He told me it's because certain places were reserved for two people. I saw multiple people sitting alone in a duo seating arrangement, it felt personal. I felt like he was taking his job far too seriously and I don't think he realises covid and the restrictions are over. Personally, it felt like a power trip.
