Exceptional,The room of the historical building is a bit dark.,"I stay in the historical room for two nights, and another tall building for another one night. The staffs are really helpful and responsive. I was not expected to get a high quality room with super city view.
Late check-in is available. 
Some of the rooms provides washing machine which is really helpful during the trip.

Great downtown hotel with great amenities,"The wifi was quite bad, probably because it was shared between all guests rather than by room.","Great location downtown with a subway stop right outside. Walking distance from the main shopping area as well. The room was big and more than enough space for two plus large luggage.
The staff were great, and very helpful.
The fitness centre was well equipped.
The mini kitchen also came in very handy.",10.0,May 2023,"May 9, 2023",Historic Double Suite,3,Family,8.5,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.00034737220594762184
"Fabulous location, great sized room.","Ok. This is the second North American 'suite' hotel I have stayed in the past 6 months (the other in NYC) and the same, albeit small, negatives apply.  I am presuming the designer in both instances was a male, and one who either didnt ask or didnt listen to any females when planning the rooms.

Theres a washer/dryer - amazing, way in excess of expectations.  And as I mentioned, the room is huge, massive, way bigger than I imagined.  However, the closet is tiny, like really really tiny, and has very little room for the length of dresses. It also has no light - I had to use my phone light to check the small amount of clothes I was able to hang up. (There was plenty of drawer space - but lots of clothes need hanging up).  The lighting in general throughout the room is poorly thought out, its incohesive and insufficient. 

 For a suite which is very suitable for longer stays, this isnt good enough. The daft thing is that there is tons of unecessary space in the bathroom behind the closet that could have been used, with very little imagination required. 

Then you have good kitchen appliances, again the dishwasher is way more than expected - but there is poor plates/cutlery/pans.  The plates etc are plastic, and there was a huge stock pot and frying pan, instead of smaller more usable items - who wants to make a massive stew!  

None of these negatives have a huge impact, partly because everything else is really fantastic.  Remodelling the closet isnt an easy fix, but the kitchen items are.","Great location.  The Path and King metro line is at the bottom of the stairs in the lobby. Ten mins walk to Union Station.  Perfect.  Quick and friendly check in, which was very welcome after a long journey from the UK.

The Tower superior suite is huge, two tv's (!), a lounge area, good size bathroom, kitchen area with washer dryer, dishwasher, fridge, microwave and small hob. The bed is comfortable, and my room had city views in three directions.

The gym/sauna is small but perfectly formed, lots of variety of equipment and it was quiet each time I went in there.

Everywhere was clean and quiet, fabulous. I would stay here again and recommend it to people I liked.",9.0,March 2023,"March 30, 2023",Tower Premium Suite,7,Solo traveler,8.5,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.00034737220594762184

Great location but not a great nights sleep.,"Our main issue was that we both found the bed and pillows uncomfortably soft and the AC/Heat unit way too loud. As a result both of us had a very poor night sleep. Additionally, our room was sold to us a large two room suite (According to the pictures/dimensions on Booking.com)but was actually a an average sized room with a kitchenette along one wall.",The location is excellent and the building is beautiful.

DISAPPOINTING STAY - WILL NOT RETURN!,"The room would have been much more spacious without the kitchen (which was of no interest to us). More significantly, however, was the absence of amenities we have become accustomed to when staying at reasonably nice hotels: there were no water bottles in the fridge, no extra blankets, no housecoats (apparently, we could have asked for all of these - but that is reactive, not proactive!). Worse was the fact that housekeeping hadn't bothered to advise that the clock was an hour off, or that the safe wasn't working (it needed fresh batteries - once they were installed, the safe lit up to show it was active again).","Excellent location. Very attractive lobby. FRONT DESK staff were great - but, as later noted, housekeeping staff really didn't do their job.

Spacious room and kind staff in a great location.,"Room was a little dated and the day I checked in I felt housekeeping was a little lacking - kitchenette could have been cleaner, scant supplies in the bathroom. The clean after Day 2 was much more thorough and lovely including more towels than I had when I checked in, etc.","Really friendly staff, great location, spacious room, had a good night's sleep, comfy bed.
It was so hot in Toronto when I was there and the air conditioning did an amazing job, thankfully!

"A bit disappointing based on previous stays, but well-priced and comfortable.","What was disappointing may have been largely due to difficulties caused by COVID. Room had no water other than Toronto tap (not nice). It was advertised as having a kitchenette; this was true, but dishes were few and cutlery, dishes and pots and pans non-existent. Fitness centre was closed. There was a fridge and a corkscrew, thank goodness! Was surprised that a $200 security/damage deposit was insisted upon at check-in; five days later it still hasn't been reversed on our credit card.",Comfortable room with a fine view of City and Lake.

"Excellent location, clean, friendly staff. Daily housekeeping is unreliable.","Daily housekeeping did not come every day of our stay there, even though we left the rooms at the same time every day for the same amount of time (most of the afternoons).

Pleasant and worth it on a discount but wouldn't stay again without,"- Room given to us was unfortunately not the one reserved. Expected to have more of a sitting area/lounge like the images, but was given more of a small square room with a desk and single chair.

Very Good,"Very loud, getting an elevator in the morning is a nightmare. Our room had a modem or something on the ceiling that was so bright it illuminated the entire room at night.

Great location and clean. Make sure you verify hidden costs and parking options before getting there,"They direct to a near by parking if theirs is full, I payed 63 dollars for a stay from 5pm-11am!!
No where on their ratings did it say a daily maximum rate and this even for down town Toronto is extremely expensive.
Their hair blow dryer is ancient and does not work, and yes I pressed in the red button, still nothing.
If you order warm water for the baby’s formula they bring it in a pot and will charge u about 5 dollars !!! I know some hotels do that but they should let you know the cost entailed ahead of time especially when you tell them it’s for a baby’s forums bottle.

Decent stay but I hope there’s better out there for the price.,"The room was disappointing. The finishes were worn — chipped paint, scuffed walls, stained counters, which made the room feel less clean.  The bed was thankfully perfectly clean, but the rest of the cleaning was not up to par — sink not washed out, dusty surfaces, streaks and watermarks on bathroom fixtures. It wasn’t dirty — it just wasn’t as clean as I would hope for the price. Noise was a problem. I was near the elevator and I could hear everything from the hall as people went by. I was woken multiple times by people talking in regular voices outside and in the middle of the night by crashing/banging from the room above. Other guests weren’t being unreasonably noisy — it just wasn’t well insulated. It was a busy time and there was often a significant wait for the elevators.","Location and view were incredible.

At check in we weren't told that some floors are not accessible by the main elevators you see when you enter the elevator area. This led to confusion and having to find our way to the historic elevators with cases and a child doesn't lend itself to a relaxing start to stay.

At night the staff/security were over zealous in checking room card (even when it was scanned on door entry) and it wasn't done in the most friendly.

I had my toiletries on the kitchen counter instead. There is a tub that takes up 1/3 of the room, which is pretty useless (at least for us). A disappointing bathroom overall. 

Parking:  I'm sure everyone sees this one a lot in the cities, as the parking is always so expensive. However, just putting it here for anyone trying to confirm cost. The hotel will charge $50+ a night for valet parking. However, this is also first come, first serve. It was full and not available when we arrived. We used a parking garage around the corner, which was fine with us to try to avoid that high cost of valet parking. However, the cost at the parking garage was just as ridiculous. The first two days, not so bad at $60 something for two night. The 3rd day, however, cost over $70 just by itself. Less than 24 hours and it cost $70+. I know this isn't the hotel's fault, but this is just to give guests that are driving in a full picture of what to plan for if staying at the hotel and will need parking... if you don't want to pay these high costs, look elsewhere or budget it in.","The room was comfortable.

An enjoyable and relaxing stay in a perfect location,"A couple of things. We had to explicitly ask for clean towels every day and for the room to be turned out.
The restaurant is too dark and the music too loud in the evening, so it didn’t feel like a place to have a nice and relaxing dinner, it’s more of a bar. There isn’t really a dedicated breakfast area either where you can sit normally and enjoy a bite before setting out for the day. So we mostly ate outside. I was misled by the image of the beautiful hall that this was the restaurant and you get to experience the decadence of the old building, but that’s only for hire it seems.","It was the perfect location, with helpful and accommodating staff.

Great value for money!,"House-keeping services were not being offered due to Covid-19 restrictions, which was annoying for long stays (I had extended my stay).

Lovely stay,"There were practically no kitchen utensils, just a saucepan for cooking, and a couple of spatulas, some eating plates, some spoons and forks, a knife and two cups. The only thing there was four of was glasses. For a stay of several days like ours this is important.
One of the days of our stay they did not make up the room, that is, they “stretched” the sheets but did not vacuum, take out the trash or replace the tea and coffee. We realized this last thing the next morning when we had breakfast. I went to the reception to ask for the coffee bags and they told us that they would bring it to the room but we waited more than half an hour and no one came. When we were leaving the room to go have coffee at the cafeteria, someone from the staff arrived with the bags of coffee, we left anyway.

Great stay.  Restaurant staff are a credit to the hotel. Good rooms and excellent location.,Separate cafe for breakfast which was not adequate for a hotel of this size. Had to walk back through to the hotel with takeout purchases to sit in the lobby. When we went for a hot option which were limited they had stopped serving half an hour before the advertised time. We gave up and went to the Sunset Grill nearby the next three mornings. The night we arrived after a very long journey the lobby area was dark with loud music playing. Quite disconcerting.

We requested an upgrade to a Tower room for the last few days (going from the 8th floor to the 47th). Well worth the extra costs. We had views of the east side and the lake. Also had separate bed room from the living space with a sofa bed. The bed was super large and very comfortable.

Great location and nice room but there were some important details that were missed.,"The room had not had a good cleaning for a while. There were greasy and even sticky light switches and grease stains on some of the walls. It was a little unsettling considering the extra cleaning that is claimed to be happening due to the pandemic. 
Also there was a very bright light from the internet router that was installed right above the bed. The bright light made it almost impossible for me to sleep. It was too high up to reach to cover it with something. 
When we arrived there was very loud music in the lobby and with the masks and plexiglass it was extremely hard to understand the receptionist. We heard almost nothing she said.

"A beautiful building and location, only very let down by the lack of care.","Unfortunately, there was water damage in the hallway before our room, and a fan/dryer was used for the time of our stay that was extremely loud and constant, night and day. We weren't offered any kind of compensation or even warned of the situation and how it might affect our stay. We also had maintenance occur during our stay and the only heads up was through a letter left in front of our door (On the day the work was to be done), so on the day they came, we didn't know they were coming until they arrived at the door. Finally, and a much smaller issue, bathroom was dated and there was no shower gel or dressing gowns available for use in the room.
There was also an extremely loud lobby, which normally wouldn't be a problem, only there was no-where to go for a quiet chat or catch-up - More of a personal preference than a problem with the hotel itself.","The checking in process was swift and hassle free.

"Good location, not a fan of the beds","My husband and I didn’t like the beds, mainly the fact that one person has to climb in from the bottom of the bed, as the wall or kitchen cupboard is against the other side of the bed meaning it’s a bit squashed when the two of you are in it and there is no where else to go or to have somewhere to put items. I’ve not seen a set up like that before and started to wonder if I’d booked the wrong room but at over £300 per night I’d have hoped the beds would have been able to get in/out both sides.

One of the best places I have been to. And Canada is simply a great country),"The only downside of this hotel was quite unstable Internet (sometimes): one hour it is rapid speed, and in a minute, it may start dropping, or even losing a connection.

Major issues were observed mainly in the morning.","Exceptional place to stay in downtown Toronto. The room was spacious, clean, with an exceptional view of the city. All necessities were provided, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, willing to address any possible questions. Free toiletries, shampoo and even mouthwash - all of high quality brands.

I should also mention the location: it is in the heart of the downtown and all possible local attractions from the list ""what to see in Toronto"" apparently were within 10-15 minutes of walking: CN tower, distillery, market, city hall, etc. There are nice parking options (look for underground parking lots with daily rates)around this hotel too.

Disappointing,"1. Minifridge was suddenly very loud at night which was very disturbing. I asked to fix it in the morning, and there was no problem and they handled it well.
2. The next day, my ceiling suddenly started dripping with water!!! I asked for maintenance and went down to the lobby because I needed to concentrate and work. I talked to the front desk and told them I am here in the lobby and if they can let me know when the maintenance are finished. I was in the lobby for almost an hour and nobody came to me, when I came to check what's up they called maintenance and apperantly they didn't even get in because I had a ""do not disturb"" on my door from earlier. It sounded like they blame me for having this on my door, but I literally came to the lobby and told them I'm here! Felt like they could be a lot more attentive and less small-minded in this matter, and to be mindful about the fact that I'm out of my room in the evening for almost an hour because of a leakage and at least check with the maintenance.
I only stayed for 3 nights, and I had issues in two of them, which is sort of disappointing.","Location, reasonable price for the area, pretty clean",4.0,July 2023,"July 16, 2023",Historic Superior Suite,3,Solo traveler,8.5,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0003240539325102419

"Great location and comfy bed, but it was not a typical 4 Star experience IMO.","The living room and bathroom were dingy.  For example, the living room sofa and accent chair had stains and felt dirty, and the bathroom hadn’t been well maintained - there was peeling wallpaper and caulk, and a shower curtain (with no liner) that  should probably be replaced soon.  The towels were not very nice and the toilet paper was 1-ply.  The hotel definitely did not feel like a 4 star hotel…more like 2, maybe 3.","The hotel has a great downtown location and the bed was very comfortable! If traveling with small children, there are quality strollers provided by the hotel free of charge - and not having to bring our own meant one less thing to lug around.

A brilliant base to explore Toronto from!  Would absolutely recommend!,"The elevator situation is a *pain*. I know one lift was broken towards the end of my stay but before that, there were wait times of up to 30 minutes for an elevator.

Check-out at 11am is a little early!","Location:- super central and walking distance to almost all of Toronto's big tourist attractions. 
Room: Stayed in a tower suite and loved it. It was a great size and had every mod con I could need; dishwasher, washing machine, fridge, only thing missing was a toaster! Bed & couch both super comfy and the bath was excellent.

Good location and reasonably priced,"Check-in was difficult as I only had a debit card physically with me, which seemed to be a problem for the front desk staff - after a long flight from England, travelling with a child and it being late at night. I didn't think the way my daughter and I were treated was acceptable at all, especially as I used a credit card to book the room (online) in the first place, so they had this on file. At one point, it felt like we were going to have to find somewhere else to stay.
Regarding the room: Its just a small shower room, no bath and bedroom overall was quite small.","Location was great. Room and communal areas were clean and tidy, nice quality bedding.
Door staff and luggage room staff - very nice and friendly.",6.0,April 2022,"May 16, 2022",Tower Deluxe Suite,1,Family,8.5,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0003227977092824709
Good,"During COVID, all amenities were closed. They also suspended all in-suite cleaning for the duration of your stay. So if you’re there for a longer stay, you have to do all your own dishes, constantly request new linens and more tea/coffee etc., and take out your own trash. It’s not much of a relaxing stay. Given that, they should at least reduce the high prices since you’re only getting half the services.","Great staff, central location, nice views, big, clean and comfy rooms.",7.9,October 2021,"October 3, 2021",Tower Deluxe Suite,3,Family,8.5,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0003227977092824709
Location is everything,"Our room was a bit tired and impersonal. The decor could do with some modernisation and flair to reflect the upscale nature of the rest of the hotel. The bathroom is well-appointed but very small, with a sliding door just off the bedroom area. Robes and slippers were not provided in the room but were available free of charge on request from guest services. 

It would have been nice to be able to order breakfast to the room: room service is only available in the evening/night so you have to go down to the cafe yourself and take away if you want breakfast in your room.

Toronto hotels are expensive, I suppose this hotel is good value for Toronto but it would be a little expensive where we are from (London UK, not a cheap place either!). I would have liked more hanging space and a better area to put our suitcases. It does feel like this hotel is aimed mostly at the single business traveller, for example our room had only one armchair. The elevators also get very busy, especially in the mornings and early evenings: allow enough time to wait for an elevator if you need to be somewhere!","One King West is a large hotel in a beautiful old bank building, ideally located in the financial centre of downtown Toronto. The hotel is 10 minutes walk from Union station and with it's own entrance to the PATH (via the old bank vault, very cool!). You can get straight to King subway or Union station via the PATH. This was an absolute bonus during our stay as the weather was both hot and stormy, so we could stay dry and with AC!

My husband and I stayed for our honeymoon and we were given a suite with a view on the 34th floor of the tower building. We had a lovely view across to the east of Toronto and down to Lake Ontario. The room had a comfortable bed, tv, kitchenette with fridge, tea/coffee making facilities, dishwasher and a small bathroom with good shower & toiletries provided. Housekeeping were very efficient, keeping us re-stocked with towels, toiletries & coffee, running the dishwasher and cleaning the room to a high standard.

We liked Teller's bar (just off the lobby) for happy hour drinks and watching sport on the tv (it was the Euro football tournament during our stay). The morning pastries & coffee from the hotel's Rituals cafe are very nice, as was the brunch we had on our first morning. We also ordered evening room service a couple of times after long days exploring Toronto. We were pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the room service food & drinks, particularly the pasta & red wine was high quality. Room service was prompt and delivery was friendly and courteous.

The gym on the 17th floor is modern & well equipped. It does get a little busy in the mornings as this hotel is popular with business travellers. There are several difference machines, a large weights area, yoga area, male/female saunas and a jacuzzi spa pool. I woke up early with jetlag one morning and had a very pleasant workout with a view over the city.",8.0,June 2024,"June 25, 2024",Tower Deluxe Suite,6,Couple,8.5,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0.0003225765007377268
Pleasant,"My shower and bathroom sink did not have hot water. I called the front desk that evening and was told maintenance would help. I received one short call from maintenance saying to ""just run the water"" that's it, which I had already tried before calling down. It was never fixed.

Not quite what we expected. As well, we called the front desk and asked for bath robes twice and they never showed up. Was quite disappointing.

"A great choice, especially if staying for more than 2 nights","We would have loved to rate this hotel higher, however our heating system was broken from day one and we were very cold throughout our entire stay (5 nights) in Toronto. This is not a reflection on the hotel itself, but it definitely put a damper on our stay (February can be extremely cold in this city). For such a highly rated hotel, this should not have been an issue. In all fairness, by day 3 we were offered another room, but we chose not to move at that point since we would have missed on our pre-booked activities.","We chose this hotel for its location and for the fact that most rooms come with a kitchen. Ours (located on the 39th floor) did not disappoint: it was very well furnished and equipped with pretty much everything we needed, including a fairly large fridge, dishwasher, and washing machine. Also, 2 TV sets. If you stay more than 2 nights in any city, having all these amenities definitely helps. Needless to say, being so high in the sky, we had an AMAZING view of the city. So amazing, that we decided to save the $90 it would have cost us to go up the CN Tower and skip this activity altogether.

Nice location and comfortable room but quite expensive for what you get.,The hotel was quite expensive. But my problems with it I think are more related to Booking Dot Com. There were more affordable room rates by the time we checked in but we couldn’t get those rates. Twice I was offered an upgrade for $10-$20 but when I confirmed the upgrades it was around $100 more expensive and I had to call both times to fix the incident. The second time Booking Dot Com didn’t even finish helping me so I cancelled the booking and booked again. This hotel might be better if I booked direct.

A perfect getaway stay,"One part of the room that felt a bit cramped was the bathroom. I very much appreciated the standing shower (I really dislike bathtubs) but there was not a lot of room to move around in there or the rest of the bathroom. Nothing much can be done about this obviously but this influenced my overall comfort. Another thing that indeed can be improved is the quality of the toilet paper - this is an upscale hotel and I was disappointed to see paper-thin, flimsy toilet paper. An upgrade will be greatly appreciated, I'm sure by many of your customers :) But other than that, I was very satisfied. 
Thanks for a great stay!","I absolutely LOVED this hotel. The location is hard to beat - everything is walking distance. The vibe was relaxing. The room was the perfect size with a kitchenette (we specifically booked a room with a small kitchen so that we could eat some quick meals in between adventures), the bed was very comfy, we had all the amenities. The hotel bar had some good desserts. We also had a great view of the city (not sure what part) because we were on the 24th floor.

"Great stay, great location, we'd stay again!","The parking lot could not accommodate my vehicle - I have a Ford Ranger and was told it would not fit in the hotel lot.  Another nearby lot was recommended and was accessible via the PATH underground network, so that was convenient and only 3 minutes away from the hotel lobby. The hotel seems to pipe in heavy perfumed scents into the lobby and common areas.  Luckily, I do not have scent sensitivities so it was more of an annoyance rather than a health issue.   The elevators were not reliable - when we checked in, only 1 of the four elevators were working so be prepared to wait in line for 15-20 minutes if that happens again and plan accordingly.  We had to modify our dinner reservations three times because of the wait. Lastly, being a beautiful old building means the plumbing is old, so in the middle of the night, when other rooms use their toilet, the plumbing system can get very loud and wake you up.  Note: we still had a great experience at the hotel and none of these factors would prevent us from booking here in the future, but other travelers might appreciate knowing these details.","The location was excellent and everything was within walking distance of the attractions we wanted to see while we were in Toronto. It is conveniently part of the underground PATH network, so in the unpredictable winter weather, we were able to get everywhere and not step foot outside.

Fantastic!  We'll be back!,"The only thing I didn't like was seeing the red indicator below this box that I am writing in slowly change to green as I type....there was nothing that we could fault with our stay at One King Street Hotel and Residence.  I am sure that many other people go and stay at places with the sole purpose to find fault...if only they bothered to engage with the people who run and work in hospitality not treat them and what they do with disdain and a negative outlook.  It's green now, so I'll stop!","Great location with access to all the sights and sites!  The team at the hotel were really helpful from the moment we walked through the door.  Checking in was easy and the room was brilliant.  Plenty of space for us and all of our stuff - room to spread and room to move!  The room had everything you would need for a long stay - not something that you get in the UK!  We spent many a happy hour in the bar/lounge area - super service from the team.  Great drinks and cocktails served with a smile and a conversation.  We ate on our second day and the hotel food was probably the best we had in Toronto and great value for money.

It was one night but perfect choice,No thing to be mentioned,"Room:
The room I stayed in was a little small, but it was certainly acceptable. The space was well-designed and utilized efficiently. While it might not be the most spacious room, I found it to be cozy and well-appointed, ensuring a comfortable stay.

Location:
The location of the hotel was exceptional, especially for those looking to experience the vibrant heart of downtown. Situated in an active area, the hotel is conveniently close to prominent attractions such as the CN Tower and other points of interest. Notably, Yonge-Dundas Square is within easy reach, adding to the convenience of exploring the city's offerings.

What I appreciated most was the hotel's access to the lower level of the city, providing direct access to a variety of restaurants and essential services. Additionally, the convenience of reaching the parking garage in the nearby building without having to step outside was a significant plus. The property itself offers parking options, and I found the 15% discount for parking in the adjacent building to be a great perk, enhancing the overall convenience factor.

Bed:
The bed in the room was a king-size bed, and I must say it was quite comfortable. After a day of exploring the city, it was a delight to return to a spacious and comfortable bed, ensuring a restful night's sleep.

Overall, I highly recommend this hotel. Despite the room being a bit on the smaller side, its prime location, accessibility to key attractions, and thoughtful amenities like the comfortable king-size bed and convenient parking options make it an excellent choice for a memorable stay in the city.",9.0,July 2023,"August 21, 2023",Tower Deluxe Suite,1,Family,8.5,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.00030206415511169

Pleasant,"The pet fee charged is somewhat unreasonable. First, it is buried in the fine print just before the booking link. Second, it is 100$ per stay which was almost as much as a night's stay.

A hidden gem in Toronto.,"My only con is the parking. If you don't get there early, there will be no parking available. This was an inconvenience when you might have a few items to carry. There is a parking garage by Wellington Street, about a 5-minute walk, that is considerably cheaper for overnights but inconvenient.  So be prepared to find alternative parking if you won't be checking in early. 

On another note, if there is an event taking place, chances are no parking will be available. Hoping something can be done to accommodate guests.","Great location in the Toronto core.

The first time I made a reservation here, I had a beautiful view and the room was nice, but the second time, it was a really bad choice! Do not pick ""interior room"" unless you just need a very dark room to sleep all day long and no light(natural or artificial) at all. It was really bad and I just wanted to leave as soon as possible. No business centre. No pool. The elevator takes years! I had to wait more than 7 minutes every time! The house keeping lady did not leave any toilet paper or tissues, neither coffee so I had to call and ask for it. The kitchen had no pots, so I asked for one since I needed it to cook food for my pet. I ordered a vegerarian pizza and did not like it so much but the size is good. The location was great and the lobby is beatiful. However, I would never go back to the same room.

Pleasant,Overall everything was good but there were couple of things that bothered us a lot. On our second night  the security guy stopped us and asked us to show him our room keys. This would be okay if he had checked everyone but he let everyone else go and stopped us all of a sudden. This seemed pretty racist of him and after i went into altercation with him about his attitude. He said he is just doing his job with no apology. They need to teach their staff how to act with their customers. This is not 1970s anymore. Nobody wants to be disrespected like that after paying over 800 dollars for the room.

Comfortable bedding and helpful staff.,"After a day of walking around downtown through the damp fog we were looking forward to using the hot tub but it was closed for renovations, which wasn't mentioned when we booked. 

It would have been nice to have a few liquid creamers to go with the coffee/tea instead of the powdered kind, and there wasn't enough sugar or powdered creamer to go with the amount of coffee pods/tea bags provided.

Disappointing this time around,"the hotel has gone downhill in the past year. We booked a 1-bedroom suite and it was TINY. We should’ve just went with one of the suites that’s open concept instead. No bath towels. Noisy. No room service menu (found an incomplete one on the TV which wasn’t useful). There’s an automated hand sanitizer dispenser in the elevator… It’s motion censored, so keeps going off if you happen to have more than three people in the elevator together. So we had to clean my daughter’s jacket several times lol. we asked for extra pillows as there was no pillows for the pull out couch, and they brought us one pillow. in the past I never had any trouble getting late check out (normally there was no charge and once I paid $25). This time when I emailed her request I was told I would have to pay $100 to check out at 1 PM.  Disappointed for a mid-week request.","Very clean

Good,"Unfortunately, after 26 hours of travelling from Europe to Toronto arriving at 00:15 am, I found that there was an over booking (I had booked over 6 months prior) for 5 nights + another night after spending 2 nights at Niagara Falls in between. We had to walk some 300m (BTW we were very exhausted with 4 luggages assisted by a front desk personnel) to a same category hotel and had to check in again the day after. Obviously, this was very disappointing not just because we where exhausted but we spoilt our first morning at Toronto to settle down. The next day at least they sent us an Uber, under my insistence and we were greeted by the hotel manager where she was very polite and apologetic. As a compensation, they waived our first night, gave us an upgrade valid also even when we returned for the single night, gave us CAD 20 daily vouchers for breakfast (enough for a pastry and a coffee each) and an additional CAD 40 to use in any restaurant at the hotel. Obviously all this eased our anger and disappointment. If it was not for this over booking I would have given a much higher rating of this hotel. Final note. We would have appreciated if they had contacted use prior to our check in regarding the over booking as we would have went straight to the other hotel and at least they could have provided us with a taxi instead of walking to the other hotel.",Location is very central and ideal with a good network of public transport.

Good,"The most annoying part of my stay was the noise I heard in my room early in the morning at 7 a.m that woke me up! I heard the staff communicating about the room cleaning schedule. Their voices were loud, it sounded that they were receiving cleaning instructions from the hotel reception and I could hear the microphone transmitting the order. This lasted for about an hour. The sound was so loud and perhaps there is no sound proof in the walls i could literally hear everything. On top of that the pillows were so uncomfortable I woke up with a neck cramp.

Lovely place to stay but…..,"The toilet paper was the worst (rough, thin and non-absorbent). Sounds petty perhaps but when you are paying close to $300/night you expect a little more. The other niggly things were not all food items listed on the room service/bar menu that is given to you at check in are available for room service but there is no information to indicate this until you call down and are advised accordingly. A simple line on the menu or asterisk next to items for bar service only would be a simple fix. Our room was supposed to be in the historic part of the hotel and I am sceptical it was as looking out the windows and from the ground it was all or at least in part in the modern addition and the room was opposite a large conference/event room that was offering some kind of breakfast buffet each morning with an early set up that woke us up two of the three mornings due to carts of tableware being wheeled past our door and set up.  We had lightbulbs that were burnt out and not working and the position of the tap in the bathroom sink was the wrong size and was positioned too far back making the end of the tap virtually touching the back of the sink making it nigh on impossible to wash your hands easily. Simple functional  elements that should have been corrected during the conversion but weren’t.  For the location the hotel is ideal. Value for the money is not there and I don’t think I would stay again as little things add up to bigger things and there are cheaper hotels in the area which are just as comfortable with similar amenities and with better t.p.","The location is perfect and less than a ten minute walk from Union Station.

"Not bad for a first visit to Toronto, but I wouldn't go to this hotel a second time.

Dirty,"The room was dirty.

Stains on the wall (both like liquid stains and brown sticky unidentified substance stains), stains on the curtains, dirty hair everywhere, dust everywhere… to the point it was rolling on the floor… food and other unidentified crumbles in basically every corner. I even found an open and rusty basting pin on the floor. The floor itself was scratched badly (like someone played with a big knife on it). Overall scratches and paint chips all over the furniture. The shower head did not work properly and dont expect to get any hygiene products cause you get one tiny bar of soap and that’s it.

At least the bed appeared to be clean.

Every time you want to take the elevator, be ready to wait 10 minutes.

There is no trolley for luggage nor help to bring them to your room so dont bring too much.

If you want ice you have to go for a 10 minute trip and go down about 18 foors (you might even have to switch elevator).

Always check-out at the front desk even if they say you don't have to.,"They text you when you arrive in your room to let you know you can use the service.

"Good location, and views but overpriced food services","Communication between staff and guests could be improved! I had an event to go to but wanted to go and use the sauna before, however I forgot my slippers! When I had called reception to request some the concierge said he would send house keeping up.  About 20 mins later I called again to check on the status he said in about 10 mins someone would be there, so I waited... nothing. Called back about 20 mins later again and a woman answered and when I asked the status of the slippers she said they had none. It was frustrating as I did not feel like the communication between staff and guests was very good, nor was my time respected. I ordered room service and it was not great. I ordered a burger and cheesecake, there was some mango puree that tasted expired, and the most random chocolate sauce poured around it.

Guest services is exceptional but hotel (especially housekeeping) has degraded seriously since pre- COVID-19,"However, I booked my stay through booking.com and was supposed to receive a $530 refund due to the issues we encountered, I even have a letter from the Hotel indicating that the hotel has processed everything with booking.com and booking.com should be refunding me. It has been since August 28th and booking.com is not responding to phone calls nor emails so I’m left defrauded of $530. 

Issues included: (1) since no housekeeping during stay, towels were supposed to be provided for the duration of the stay, we received towels for one person for one day for a two person four night stay. Requested more and had a bag of towels and toiletries dropped at the room door including (2) a bunch of wet dirty cleaning rags blended in with the clean towels. (3) duvets in two of the three rooms we were in were probably 15 years old and had absolutely no stuffing. (4) the second room we got had non-functioning air conditioning; or actually it was a suite where only the main living space was air conditioned but the bedroom area couldn’t get below 26 degrees at all. (5) the second room’s shower stall was full of black curly hairs on the walls, indicating zero effort being made to clean it. 

Overall, guest services was absolutely wonderful and corrected all of the housekeeping deficiencies (hopefully long-term and not just for my own stay), but unfortunately until booking.com refunds me my $530, I am forced to leave negative reviews for both booking.com and One King West. If I ever see my refund, I will adjust One King West’s review to account for the efforts the hotel made to remedy issues. In the meantime, I’m just feeling defrauded.","So to start, I wasn’t going to leave a negative review from a negative experience because Guest Services and management truly went out of their way to correct for concerning housekeeping issues and bellhops trying to squeeze more than the allowed number of people in each elevator on a regular basis (yes, guests had to enforce the two people per elevator policy bc the hotel employees encouraged people to cram in like sardines when it was busy).",1.0,August 2021,"September 8, 2021",Tower Deluxe Suite,4,Couple,8.5,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0.00028415048556116104
Mediocre at best: in need of new management and a thorough makeover.,"My room was dingy and in need of refurbishment -- it is very strange in room that can obviously accommodate a couple to have only one comfortable chair. There should be two chairs or two seat sofa in king bedrooms. The hotel staff, particularly the manager I spoke to, was condescending when I expressed my concerns about the hotel staff not wearing masks. A mask recommendation had just been issued n Toronto -- recommended, not required indoor masking. She and her staff decided to largely ignore the situation with the new Omicron variant, which put me at risk and made me extremely uncomfortable while I was staying there. I met with the manager to explain my concerns and she adopted a negative and rude tone of voice with me and dismissed my concerns. I also received poor advice about local dining -- on my arrival around 10pm, I was sent somewhere that was closed for maintenance but the hotel concierge had assured me it was open, even though the Open Table website said there were no tables available. When I returned from my futile trip to the restaurant she apologized but then I had to order room service which cost an astounding $38 for a club sandwich consisting of hunks of greasy meat and a beer (the room service charge of $5 was waived). I found the staff at the front desk to be generally grumpy and perfunctory. (I noted here as elsewhere that aspects of the public spaces are filthy -- the globe lamps hanging over the front desk area are covered in dust). I do think the price for the hotel is quite competitive, but it could not be any higher because of the dingy quality of the interior, the poor service and the insufficient number of elevators for a building of this size. The view from my room was extraordinary and made up for some of the other faults.",I liked the view from my room.,3.0,July 2022,"August 7, 2022",Tower Deluxe Suite,1,Solo traveler,8.5,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0.00028406657969445474
"Downgraded at my checkin without any reason, the beginning of the end!","The comminication mainly. Hard to understand the staff because of the noise (we had the impression to arrive in a night club at 10pm for our checkin). Plus, they announced us we are downgraded. They hardly know the concept of empathy, more the concept of business. I saw some clients negociate some stuffs like we were in market or in a developped country. So, they show sometimes no empathy to us, international customers. I speak mainly dor the communivation, they could make an efdort and articulate a bit more. Also and mostly, I didn't like to be downgraded... without any explanation. Waiting for a 30% off on the night downgraded but still nothing after 5 days. Not them to manage, will be booking business of course..

Nobody show us around aftet the checkin or explain how works the hotel, the services, the room service, the entrance. I had to ask them and ask some amenities all the time, like soap or basic things for the suite. It is not a classic hotel, it's an hotel and residence to be accurate. They could explain better their concept and their system.
The restaurant of the hotel ask you to tips when the tips are already included, called ""gratuity"". They know that we are not from Canada: A french and a bresilian. They could explained instead of say nothing. I paid $125 for two steacks frites with 30 min late and not with the right cooking for the steaks. They clearly abuse of the tourists when they can..

I tried to express my unsatisfaction to the lobby at multiple times, they make me feel terrible about it so I prefer to stop saying anything.
Also, I have to say, I was impatient to come back home because my bed and my pillow are way better.. I had to ask a duvet and some pillow because the ones we had were crashed, like nothing inside. It's a lot for a first night after being downgraded without any explanation..","I like the location even if they didn't tell us they have a direct access to the courtroom/underground gallery who lead to the subway.

Nice views but not family friendly or worth the money. Other more friendly and stylish hotels in TO.,"The staff were rude, especially so in relation to us travelling with our two children. My kids (age 10 and 12) were behaving just fine when we checked-in but the staff member went out of her way to repeat several times that we would be kicked out of the hotel if there were two noise complaints (I've never had a hotel threaten me like this at check-in!) and that my kids could not walk around the hotel by themselves. I listened in to people checking in without kids and did not hear any of this. We had booked a suite with two queen beds but when we opened the room it smelled so strongly of dog/dog food we requested a different room. The only suite left had a small and terribly uncomfortable hide-a-bed that barely fit my two kids. I wouldn't stay here again -- totally not worth it.

Location perfect.,"Room was a bit dusty. I ran the bath and there was a lot of dust floating after filing it up.
I picked this room because it had a separate bedroom (convenient to put baby to sleep early) but the doors separating the bedroom and living room were made of see-through glass which I thought was strange. There was also a fair amount of noise from the street but we used a sound machine so it wasnt as noticeable.

Impressive accommodation with some annoying defects,"The microwave in our room turned on but did not heat anything.  The toilet ran (water leakage from the tank into the bowl) creating an annoying noise of flowing water.  I had to reach into the tank several times to fix the problem.  One of the cupboard doors was askew on its hinges.  There were no instructions or soap for either the dishwasher or the in-suite laundry machine, nor was there a dish towel.  Pretty simple problems to solve, which leads one to believe that the hotel management either doesn’t know how to operate a 4-star establishment, or simply doesn’t care.","Great central location in downtown Toronto close to Union Station, Bay Street, and a subway station on the Yonge Street line (Yonge-University Line).

I do not recommend but the staff are nice and helpful. It’s not worth the money!,it’s old style hotel furniture and does not deserve 4* rating. Parking is extremely expensive. Toilets are not renovated and are not the cleanest. The heater in my room was broken and not working at all. TVs are not smart and old version. Beds and pillows are not comfortable. I don’t advise to use the sofa bed for sleeping because it’s so terrible. the worst thing in this hotel is that your room door will be knocked each morning between 8:30-10:30 without requesting a room service to clean up your room and they will keep knocking your door until you open. This is so annoying considering that there is a big chance that people are sleeping so by waking them up you are interrupting their time of rest and privacy. I have noticed this happened to other guests next to my room in addition to my personal experience!,the location is central. easy to access. the internet at the hotel is good with fast speed. staff are helpful and cooperative. it’s nice that there is washing and dryer machine in addition to a dishwasher (you need to get your detergent).,4.0,January 2022,"January 2, 2022",Historic Double Suite,2,Family,8.5,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0.0002804679144051766

Nice Hotel in the heart of Toronto with great views of the city.,The service is a cross between a longer-term rental and a nice hotel.  The towels should be improved.  I would expect to see a more plush bigger towel set for the style of the hotel but they were plentiful and changed daily.  Parking was not available which was inconvenient but there was plenty of parking close to the hotel and we left the car all weekend in favour of walking and Uber rides so it was not a big deal.  The restaurant is in the lobby and would be considered more of a bar.  It was not appealing to us but I am sure it appeals to 20-35-year-olds.,The room was originally on the 20th floor with a below-average view.

Great hotel for downtown Toronto,"Not dislikes but suggestions for slight improvements: please put more than one T bag per night in the room for your English travellers and some mini milk cartons as tea or coffee with creamer just doesn't work. Also, it is unusual to find a hotel with aircon that doesn't provide a small bottle of water. The rooms are a little dark even with all the lights on. Perhaps one additional main bright light would help. I think you should signpost your kitchenette facilities better on the booking.com website as if I'd known it was available in advance, I would have packed fewer clothes and washed clean when here.  These are all very minor and did not detract from a great stay.","I really liked this hotel. The hotel has great character. Rather than just being a boring building, it has some history, which gives it a good feel. It makes you feel more relaxed and at home than ""staying away."" The staff are super friendly and efficient. The bar is lively and offers good bar food and a selection of cocktails. The valet parking is helpful, although there are limited spaces, so you are not guaranteed a spot. I stayed 4 nights and got a spot 3 out of 4 times, but there is local parking a couple of minutes walk away. The room had a very comfortable bed and was quiet with a good shower. The built-in kitchenette is an excellent idea with a dishwasher, washing machine, fridge, hob, and microwave tastefully installed.  I loved The Daily Ritual Coffee Shop built into the hotel. Being open to the public means you get a standard of service and speed, which you would expect from a Starbucks but with better coffee and food.",10.0,December 2022,"December 8, 2022",Historic Superior Suite,4,Solo traveler,8.5,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0.0002721767015644214

Delightful visit to Toronto.,"The bathroom was awkward. The door was large and opened into the room. With the door open, you couldn’t easily stand at the sink. With it closed, it felt somewhat claustrophobic. This would have been the perfect opportunity for a door that slides across the opening. Also, we didn’t like that we couldn’t order breakfast room service. This may just be a cultural difference but there was no room service and service in the lobby was confusing. Customers had to go next door to place their orders and then the food was delivered to their tables but it wasn’t as nice as actual waitress service.",We had what I imagine was a smaller Tower suite on the 22nd Floor.

Good location but would likely won't return.,"- We told the hotel that we were staying for our 15th anniversary, ended up in a room at the end of a hall near housekeeping.. it was Very loud early in the morning (8-9am). Wasn't able to sleep in at all due to housekeeping staff being extremely loud.. it sounded like they were just constantly yelling back and forth in the halls
- TV was a bit small for the room
- One cocktail at the lobby bar is 20$....... 
- We ordered room service at about midnight... Very uncomfortable situation, wouldn't recommend!! The delivery man came right into our room and was very loud. My husband answered the door and the guy just came right on in and was talking to me while I was sitting on our bed.. so awkward.. like just deliver our order at the door and allow for some privacy. It was a very uncomfortable situation.. I also have no idea what the guy was even saying because his English was so poor. 
- There was a very dirty, wet, stinky cloth on the side of the bathtub when we arrived... for the cost of one night stay, this shouldn't be happening. 

This was our second stay at this hotel. First time there last year, we loved it. After a second stay here, I'm not sure we would stay a third time.","- location was great for being able to walk to the Rogers Centre 
- lobby area is beautiful, but that's not enough to make me return.

lovely location but disappointing hotel experience,"Facilities like the gym and restaurants were closed and there was no housekeeping service for the duration of our two week stay. We were told local lockdown rules (introduced after we had booked) meant no one could come in our room to change bed linen or clean despite the length of our stay. As we were in Toronto for family reasons we had quite a lot to do and had booked a hotel, for comfort and ease; not self catering accommodation. When we arrived the bathroom door didn’t close and the phone didn’t work in our room, both required separate maintenance team visits which seemed contradictory when housekeeping weren’t allowed in. It felt like no thought had been given as to how two weeks with no cleaning at all would work in practice, especially with snow outside meaning boots bringing in salt/dirt/wet each day; no cleaning products or equipment were left in the room, or bathroom and this would have been an obvious solution; no one wants to ask for a loo brush or spend time sourcing and buying cleaning products while paying for a hotel service - but we did. We had booked a suite, so fortunately it had a washing machine and they did give us some sachets of powder when we asked for it (and had to ask for more like Oliver Twist) but washing our own towels and having to have the dryer on what felt like endlessly in our living/sleeping space was far from ideal. The bath/shower drainage was blocked and took 4-5 hrs to drain, a lightbulb in the bathroom was out. With no one collecting rubbish we were asked to use the garbage room & chute in the hallway, but then this was closed so garbage had to be stored in room until it reopened a few days later. It was all very dissatisfying.","Great downtown location, close to transport links and lake, interesting building and history",3.0,January 2022,"February 25, 2022",Tower Premium Suite,11,Couple,8.5,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0.00026271072721608215

Very Poor,"When I booked my room I was quoted a price. At check-out I was required to pay an additional 17% due to taxes that were not disclosed at the time of reserving the room. 
I understand that the price at the time of reservation is quoted as an approximate. I imagined that this is due to possible changes in forex rates for example. 
A near 20% increase in cost to a customer due to undisclosed taxes at the point of reservation cannot form part of the original quoted price’s ‘approximate’. 
One King West Hotel knows exactly what taxes apply per room per stay. That One King West Hotel withholds such charges from the quoted price in order to appear more affordable is misleading and deceiving.

It was clear the rooms were not properly cleaned from whoever stayed before us and made me feel really uncomfortable, especially having to sleep there for 2 nights and feeling like the sheets might not have been changed at all. Wouldn’t have been as upset if it was just a mishap with the first room and I also get that hotels are never going to be as clean as home, but the fact that 3 rooms were dirty shows their cleaning standards are obviously low, which made the stay very uncomfortable.

Meh.,"Great location but the room was very overpriced for what it is. The valet was easy to use, but also quite expensive. One of our beds was broken. The room is tiny and while it has a kitchenette, everything is very small. It felt like a small dorm room room rather than a hotel room, which is fine but not what I thought I was paying for.

"Comfy beds and great food, but comes with having to deal with power-hungry staff who bully their guests.","There were 3 male staff who were extremely rude, power-hungry, and bullying female guests. Two yelled at us to show our room keys when we arrived back after 8pm the first night (we knew we had to tap them to get in but didn’t know we had to physically show them to the front desk). One of those men tried to grab something out of my wallet they thought was my room key without asking, in quite an aggressive manner. We saw them continuously doing this to other women too, but letting men walk right on by. Also, one security guard said to my friend on our second day “what, you can’t read?” in a condescending tone. She had been told the day before to use the automatic door, even though there’s a sign saying to not use it and use the revolving one instead, so she followed this the next day and that was his response to her.

Good location - awful hotel.,"1. Tye room 1301 smells like a dead fish cemetery. Absolutely awful - made me puke. 
2. The designation “historic” should be changed to “run down” and “filthy” - from elevators to carpeted floors in hallways.
3. Staff was very rude. The attendant who was retrieving my bags from the storage room was flirting with another customer who just checked in, and afterwards she was taking forever to locate my bags. 
4. Valet parking needs some kind of signage - I had to drive around the hotel at least twice before I found it.
5. Not enough luggage carts. Very few.

I tried to clear it up with reception but they spent 15 minutes trying to tell me it was basically the same room. Thing is I wouldn’t have minded the change if the “upgraded” room had a decent view, but it was only on the 19th floor (out of something like 45+ floors) and the bathroom window faced the rooftop exit of the adjacent building.

Disappointing,"Rude valet staff. Came out to get car and was told to go to front desk rather rudely. My car was right in front of him. After I said no and why I needed to go back inside the hotel and just started walking to my car , another valet person helped me and gave me my keys.

My other complaint is with the complete lack of any soundproofing of the walls and food doors of the suite. At 2 am , there were some drunk guests making g noise outside of my room. I could clearly hear everything they said from my bed. They subsequently went inside their suite next to mi e and I could still clearly hear them . Hotel security had to come up several times to tell them to keep the noise down.  I understand that there will occasionally be loud inconsiderate guests but having some sound proofing would help the other guests deal with such situations. Also, why does the door to the suite have to slam in order to close? Could there not be ant hanisn to stop it from slamming and walking up 1/2 the floor every time someone goes in and out of their room?

Went looking for an ice machine staying on the 6th floor,  from 6 up to 10 there are NO SIGNS what so ever about an ice machine, i ran into a lady who had walked in an HOUR ago to book, travelling from Alberta, and was staying on the 30th floor lol, when I booked online the night before and made my reservations and checked in at 5pm I was told there was only ONE suite left and forced to this specific suite lol. The suite was a NIGHTMARE, i had plans to have a romantic night/day with my girlfriend and the second we looked into the washroom to take a shower we were pushed back into 1980s! the room not only looked like it was last renovated/built in the 80s with the old tiling but the disgusting mould and dirt that was filled in the grouts i had to shower closing my eyes, and my girlfriend refused to shower, when i complained about our room the staff told me the the same, there was only that suite left.

Normal waiting time for elevator 10-15 minutes, always full of families arriving or leaving holiday, suitcases, pushchairs, cannot get in  the elevator.

Instructions for the internet router incomprehensible, router found buried in the broom cupboard under the stools, broken furniture, mops, vacuum cleaner, buckets, plastic boxes, cleaning materials.
TV has NO CHANNELS AT ALL, SO NO TV. Told by host no one wants to watch TV. I DID.
Finally given password to Netflix. Had to install that ourselves.

Not recommended for traveling with family,"It’s overpriced consider the size and the quality of the room. Our first room was right by the elevator and we can hear it running in the middle of the night. The staff told us all the good rooms with a view are near the elevator. On top of that, the fridge in our room can’t be opened as it’s blocked by the cabinet. The TV is also broken. The staff told us in the morning they will fix it while we are going out, but it was still broken after we returned at 3pm. We had to call them again to get a service ticket opened. Not sure if that means they didn’t do anything until we compliant again. TV is kind of a big deal if you are traveling with a kiddo. They later offered to switch us to a lower floor room without a view (picture#2) which is not ideal. Not exactly what you would expect for $400 a night. Even though the staff tried to help us eventually, but it does still feel like a ripe off considering the quality of the room, speedy of service and the bad service recovery plans. It feels like the customer are paying for all the inconvenience caused by the hotel. It’s a ok hotel for people who are traveling alone and does plan to use any amenities in the room, but I would not recommend it if you are traveling with family. I would pick other hotel chains instead. They are significantly cheaper but more reliable. This experience proofs that expensive does not mean better. Overall, bad value for the money.

If I have to stay at this hotel again I will stay and I recommend it to others.,They do not open the sofa bed before arrival even though they know the number of people occupying the room.

There is also King Station in-front of the hotel which saved us walking sometimes when we didn't want to walk from or to Union Station. For breakfast we could bring our food from the Ritual Cafe and take it in the hotel lobby and that way we could enjoy the hotel environment and the comfort and make our stay at the hotel more pleasant.,10.0,July 2023,"August 20, 2023",Tower ONE Suite,4,Family,8.5,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0.00024560542776987045

"MISTREATED BY HORRIBLE MANAGER, I WILL NEVER BE BACK","Upon arrival I was told that the Suite I had booked with a view on an upper floor was not available and that they were very sorry. They said I was being placed in a non-suite room on a lower floor and to compensate me will give me a food voucher. I was very upset but couldn’t do anything about this, and didn’t want to cause a scene in front of my girlfriend. The manager assured me the room was not of lesser value but that turned out to be a complete lie when I got to the room and checked the pricing on the hotel website. He also said I will be given 2 breakfast vouchers worth $40 per person. When I got to the room and checked the vouchers it entitles the holder to one coffee and a croissant or pastry and the manager had the audacity to lie to my face that a coffee and croissant is worth $40 per person. I was so mad, first my room that I paid good money for was not available for no reason, and I was put in a worse room and lied to about the value of the food voucher and not compensated the difference in the rate of my lesser value room which the manager lied about. 

The cherry on top for this absolute horrible service was when I then asked the manager if he could refund my $70 valet parking to compensate for this awful treatment and he said no. That’s how they treat there guests who they promised to accommodate for there own mistake???

I WILL NEVER BE BACK, SHAME ON THIS ESTABLISHMENT FOR SUCH HORRIBLE SERVICE AND MISTREATMENT. I FEEL SCAMMED","I was too frustrated with the service and how I was mistreated to appreciate anything.

You get what you pay for.,"The hotel section we stayed in is old, and not the nice kind of old. Dusty, old, worn and scratched furnishings. Carpets look like they get cleaned by accident. Housekeeping isn't scheduled, so you have to request it. Room service incurs an additional charge - for subpar, expensive food, at that. Interior view promised in the offer is obstructed by a construction tarp. Ice is only accessible on a single floor of the hotel. Vending machines that accompany it are spotty - one took $3.50 and didn't give any product. Dishwasher in the room, but no detergent. Closet space is useless, as the clothing bar is against the wall.

First, we were put into a room with an interior view, and all I have to say is Yikes. the interior view is literally a blue wall that is under construction. Hotel staff were able to put us into another room. however we were not told the floor we were being put on was a resident floor with people who live at the hotel. the floors were unvaccumed and dirty, and the hallways were used for storing rollaway beds and laundry bins. the whole thing was way below the standard we are use to at this hotel.

I didn’t stay!!!,That I was forced not to check in due to the agent telling me I couldn’t without my credit card.,"I didn’t go and I tried to cancel because I was told at 10:00 am October 30,2022 that I had to have a credit card for the hotel to put on the security deposit. I let the agent know that my credit card had been compromised and I had been trying to reach loss and prevention to get it resolved. The hotel agent told me they would NOT check me in even though the room was already paid for unless I had a credit card to be charged for $250 security deposit. She continued to tell me that VISA or MasterCard debit was not allowed nor was a cash deposit. I told her then i needed to cancel the reservation and get my money back as this credit card issue was beyond my control. I want my money refunded to my credit card as I let the hotel know at 10:00 am that I couldn’t get my credit card fixed for the time of check in. She then said that o could check in later. I let her know that I couldn’t get it done by then because when talking with my credit card company I was told that it could take up to 2 business days to get the issue resolved.  The agent then said I could get a friend or relative to use their credit card for the deposit. However, they would need to have the hotel email them all the forms and releases them print them up and sign them then fax all of the forms back to the hotel along with their picture I.D.  I did call 2 friends to see if either could do it but one was at work and couldn’t as they didn’t have access to a fax machine or printer as the office was locked until Monday. The other friend was at a wedding and couldn’t do it. My one sister is in Aruba and didn’t get back to me in time to do it.  Therefore I have been requesting that my credit card be refunded as I let the hotel know immediately about my credit card and I was told that I could not check in without it. I do not feel I should pay for a service I did NOT receive especially when every other hotel allows either cash or debit cards to be used for the deposit.",1.0,October 2022,"November 1, 2022",Historic Double Suite,1,Couple,8.5,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0002292832081604206

do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel,"horrible policy of 250$ for damage deposit charged BEFORE the stay. I had to extend my stay nightly on booking.com, and despite staying in the same room; due to them being separate bookings I had to pay the damage deposit 3 TIMES - so by the end of my stay I was out 750$ in pending “damage deposit” fees. I have never ONCE seen this policy or way of business dealing in any of my travels or bookings on this website, and I’ve been all over the world.

The date I am checked in the elevator has broken, but I had never been told of this information, which makes me confused on their 12th floor which they called as cross tower floor.

The most ridiculous part of this hotel is that this hotel is the only star rated hotel I have lived in Canada charges late check out fees. due to the delay of my airline flight, I had asked if I can delay my checking out time to 12pm, and for one hour delay they ask for 100 dollar.

would not stay again unless they made actual updates and fixes to rooms,"I'd like to start off by saying that we truly did enjoy our stay. The hotel itself is beautiful, and has a very interesting history that we enjoyed learning. The real issue it the room itself.

However, I will say, this hotel was a splurge for us. It was approximately $300 a night, plus $55 a night to park our vehicle. We hadn't been on vacation in a while, and wanted to treat ourselves to a nicer hotel than we're used to. We stayed 3 nights, and the total cost was about $1,300. I wanted to write this review as a cautionary tale to the fellow budget travelers like me.

Firstly, the guest service is immaculate. Front desk, valet, concierge, bartenders and servers at the Teller's Bar- they were all wonderful. It particularly stuck out to me that after a night out, we entered the lobby and requested bottled water, the concierge informed us that it would be sent to our room. From there, we proceeded directly to the elevator and right to our room, where the water was sitting in a bag on our door handle waiting for us. I had to pick my jaw up off the floor from this kind of service. The management should be proud of this incredible staff.

Now for the less than favorable part... for the amount of money spend on this hotel, the room was appallingly bad. The room didn't match the rest of the hotel in any way, quality or design. I feel like this room hasn't been updated or maintained at all. There were solutions put in place to fix things around the room that I wouldn't expect anyone older than a middle-schooler to think of. The room was so severely disappointing. There was no overhead lighting except for immediately upon entering, and in the washroom, so it was fairly dark in the room. The back of the bathroom door was all scraped up and there was a molding piece on the back that was hanging off. The wallpaper is peeling in many areas throughout the room, the shoe trim is scraped and scratched and marked all over.",Historic and beautiful lobby.

"Comfortable, quiet for staycay!","For a person my height, 5’ 1”, I found the kitchenette awkward and difficult to work in. Built for much taller people.

The microwave is on the high side as well… there wasn’t a pot or pan to be found so using the burners wasn’t possible. 
I was only there two nights, so ordered dinner or purchased food from the cafe.

Poor,"For starters, when I was checking I was not able to pay with a visa gift card that I received for my anniversary. The attendant that was servicing me was so quick to cancel my booking. Claiming if you can't get any friends or family to use their card then what I will do is just cancel. She went to the back to speak with the manager and even though I have cash to pay for my room that many decided to stay in the back behind the walls and not assist. There must be a way to get around that so called policy. Even after I said  I booked for my husband 40th birthday as a surprise and I was coming from our of town she was so quick to just cancel. I had to stop mid way and tell her NO dont cancel let me process what's happening because at that point my husband was on his way. She did not give 2 shots about customer service or even providing any kind of Solution. After finally getting assistance from a friend got to my room and why was it dirty, popcorn in the corner of the room along with under the living room tv and table. When I called to notify front desk all the did was send house keeping. I had to ask if at that point can I get late check out, it wasn't even offered. Further more eating at the restaurant was mediocre I should have gotten pizza and put a candle in it to make a big deal of my husband's milestone.

disappointed,"I was so disappointed this time around. 
We had no onsite parking which made it super difficult to access the building with all the city construction. We had to talk three blocks to get back to the hotel after finding parking. 

Vault is no longer accessible it’s being used for construction workers to gather in. You can’t see the safety deposit boxes any longer once again being used for a storage space and junk. The building that has so much history has been taken from that. You weren’t able to check out the ballrooms, basically everything that you used to be able to explore and learn about was gone. 

Our toilet ran all night when we told them they said there wasn’t much they could do but have someone fix it when we left. Our bed was so uncomfortable I tossed and turned all night. The guy working check out in the morning was less then pleasant and when informing him about our toilet issue he didn’t have much to say and didn’t seem to care about how are stay was.","It’s one of my favourite hotels in the city.

Restaurant music was far too loud for the average person to eat and enjoy other company. Staff not very approachable on this. Patrons at the bar very loud as well. Is this a bar or a restaurant?

Bad,"There's no parking at this hotel, and valet service has minimal spaces to accommodate their guests. The soundproofing in the rooms is exceptionally bad. You can hear everything in the hallway and in other rooms. The noise and movement from room to room make it impossible to sleep.

When security finally showed up, he banged on the door for 15 minutes, and I could hear the entire conversation from my room.

Downtown wedding and party hotel￼,"The tower that have my room faced the lake and had fabulous views on three sides however it was poorly appointed some of the furnishings were dusty and in fact reminded me of a college frat room it just looked tired the bathroom was definitely not up to standard and there was no soap provided I had to call the front desk so I could wash my hands. it never came and then when I left the room I noticed it was on the floor outside the room. I need a little square so far 2“ x 2“
This room had one of the worst fitting doors I’ve ever seen at any hotel there was about an inch gap under it which allowed for all the noise from the hallway and the light from the hallway to come into the room …. that’s a problem which I advised the front desk of and they said there was nothing that could do about it I said my wish is that you to make a note of it, so maintenance can do something : they can put rubber gaskets on the bottom of the door to deal with noise transfer and light issues , privacy issues,  this is a maintenance issue the hotel needs to deal with later on.
At night there were two rooms adjoining my room both of which had for young people in them and I would say they were party rooms. This hotel
would  not make for a good stay for a solo traveller coming back from Europe. I would say this venue is more for the 20 to 30 age group crowd who want to come downtown Toronto and party hard on the weekends.",I love the historical aspect of the property it’s fascinating to explore it as it was originally the Dominion bank of Canada you can go up to the grand banking Hall which is now used for weddings and go down to the Fabulous vault area which used to be the safety deposit box area both use breathtaking marble staircases to access them,5.0,July 2022,"July 20, 2022",Tower Premium Suite,2,Solo traveler,8.5,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.00016192673852493718

Booking and hotel were NOT in sync.,"Booking website said one thing, hotel another. Literally said I could pay upon arriving and I used a lower limit credit card to hold the reservation and they tried charging the amount and then the deposit. I sent an email saying I intended to pay for the hotel upon check in with my boyfriend credit card and asked if they needed the number. A seemly loving person replied that they did not need the card as it was sensitive information. Meanwhile I was receiving messages from the app telling me they were trying to charge my card and if I didn’t upload the number in the system I would lose my reservation. Over and over.
