Great cityscape view and great location...,"Lack of lighting in the rooms. 
can't go to ground floor directly in one elevator. you'll always have to come to 17th floor and then change elevator to go up or down which is very annoying. 
breakfast is very expensive if you have to buy it.","the place is in great location. all the street shops, food stalls and night markets are just below the the hotel.

Fantastic!,"The coffee.
The original room I was given on the 51st floor was clean and comfortable but a little tired looking.","I got a free upgrade which I didn't ask for simply because my room safe didn't work. The room I moved to was huge complete with its own enclosed 10 metre wide balcony. I was on the 55th floor so the views of Bangkok were spectacular. 
The breakfast buffet - this wasn't part of my booking but I happily paid the 350 baht each day - was on the 82nd floor and circled the whole of the floor with a vast range of breakfast fare, mostly Asian but with familiar western options: toast, eggs bacon, cereal, fruit etc. Seating was both inside, and outside on open balconies which allowed a wonderful way to start the day.

great location,"The first night I stayed in room 2514 - at 6 am I heard some loud noises. I was awful. The room was close to the maid’s room. It seems that they were throwing some towels or bed sheets down through some tube and it made the laud noise. I got so mad I called the reception and yelled at them to make the noise stop. It didn’t stop. I got angry, and demanded for them to change my room (I did’t sleep for 2 nights before that, and this was my 3rd night which I didn’t get enough sleep). Unfortunatelly I used some words, and I fellt sorry about that, but I was very tired. They changed the room. However, the new room was separated by the adiacent room through a door. The women from the adiacent room were packing their luggage until 3
am to leave Bangkok and were making a lot of noise - that was my 4th night of being sleep deprived…  Due to bad soundproofing, because of the door that connected our rooms - it felt that they were packing and talking in my room.
I talked with the duty manager and we come up with an arrangement to compesant the troubles I had there during 2 out my 3 nights staying at their hotel.","I selected this hotel for its location. The 84 floor is amazing. The dinner at the 83 floor had a magical view.  Close to the hotel you can find exchange boots, massage salons, street food. The malls are at a 30 min walking distance.

"This was a great experience to stay here, loved the views of Bangkok","The wifi was only reachable standing by or very close to the door of our room, and the one big thing that let this place down was the bell boy helped us with our luggage, he took one easy to wheel suitcase (while we took the rest) up a lift to our room with us, then he stood by the door staring and said nothing and so I asked him what he was waiting for and he hinted blank faced- a tip. I thought this was very rude and greedy, and a bad taste for such an expensive hotel this service should be part of it. This place has a huge number of guests all over the world not a bad thing just means it was really busy so expect that city hotel busy vibe (maybe not why you want with small kids, in contrast to other places) but we enjoyed it. Buffets were super expensive but the Ala Cart menu food was good.","We only had one night here but was supposed to have two, I think two would have been better as the place is huge and lots to see/ look around. The upper viewing decks were stunning but only open from 10am to 10pm, I would have loved to go up for the sunrise. The room itself was simple but nice, a bit old looking. Loved the big glass windows, comfortable beds. Reception staff were friendly and welcoming, location was good as there were plenty of food and clothing stalls at the pop up night market outside (more so clothing and lots of Indian restaurants) and plenty of massage options.

Good,"Hotel is among the oldest in Bangkok and a general cleaning should be done urgently . Cigarettes smoke feels across entire hotel even in non smoking floors because the ventilation system is the same. The carpets are old and not cleaned.

"Good, centrally located hotel with a great view","However,  the hotel is a bit dated and as a result, there's squeaking coming out of the corridors (probably the pipes) which can be heard in the rooms (fixed with earplugs), and the wifi in my room at least kept getting disconnected (which was also fine because I had available data to use).

They didn't bother to replace the kitchen ware that warn off with chipped mark. I know its an old hotel with long history but i think the hotel management guys should spend some money to improve it.

BTW.

It was interesting to be accommodate in such a big hotel but it will likely be a one time experience,The elevators were fairly confusing.

Wonderful,"Breakfast costs 350THB and we thought not to take it, hoping to find something to eat around. Then we noticed that in Thailand it doesn't matter if it's the morning, the lunch or the dinner, people eat always the same things (fried staff, heavy staff), so we ended up in a supermarket buying some buscuits, and it was so miserable. Bakeries don't exist or are well hidden in the forests of the markets. Don't expect to find fresh bread, be happy with the readymade sandwich if you happen to find it. So after this we decided to take the hotel breakfast, which frankly speaking was OK, but 90% thai and chinese food, and for europeans by all these interesting things, and english hot breakfast looks like a light salad :-). Lucky us we found pancake and fruit - last day we found some chese as well, for bread they only have industrial toast bread.","The hotel itself is fantastic, so you can even forget some facts like how much the room would need a renoval, or how much it is disturbing that you pay extra to get a room on higher floor (60th) and you get a room where a huge advertisement is sticked on the window disturbing the view. It is great they offer a welcome drink in a bar at the 19th floor and it is also cool you can go up to the 360grade panorama terace, which is on the 84th floor if I remember well.

Still the best view in Bangkok!,"It's a big hotel - at least 40 floors are dedicated to hotel accommodation, just bare this in mind - there are a lot of people here, including large tour groups.  Breakfast is close to bedlam! Great that they have now dedicated two floors to breakfast but still very packed and sometimes hard to secure a table.  With so many customers the lifts are always busy and it would be nice if some people would wait until you get out before trying to push their way in - despite the best efforts of the staff to ask them to wait - not the fault of the hotel but be prepared for it!  The pool could do with some umbrellas set around maybe -there is no shade and the pool area gets the sun most of the day","We have stayed here a number of times and still love it - book the high rooms - the view is the best we have ever had in Bangkok!  The check in staff are fantastic and so helpful.  Awesome markets at the base of the hotel and street - really good prices.  Price of the hotel is very reasonable and while parts of the building are showing their age,  it's the staff that make the hotel!  As smokers, we are glad that there are still floors dedicated to smokers (if you ask for a non-smoking room you will not be put on these floors) as well as dedicated smoking areas around the hotel - please don't change this!

"Disappointing location, service and experience. Don't waste your time.","On check in we were told the room we booked and paid for was unavailable, however, if we paid an extra surcharge for each of the 5 nights it would miraculously be available for us. The facilities, especially the lifts and dining options appeared to prioritise the enormous coach loads of tourists flocking to the location - to the point where it felt that having paid to stay in the accommodation was punishing and we regretted our choices. The offer of free WiFi sounds great but it is really slow and you have to log back into it every three hours!!! Also, the area surrounding the hotel was the least pleasant we experienced throughout our entire stay in Thailand and felt unsafe both during the day and at night. We booked for 5 nights and checked out after 2 nights with different accommodation found near the river.",The view from the observation deck was incredible.

Very Good,"They have a tour desk with lots of tour package options but I found it a bit disorganized. We booked 2; the dinner cruise where we were 3 groups with different cruise boats and times (don’t know how since we were not offered options on boats and times) and we had to wait an hour for the last group/tour before we had to go back to the hotel - already almost midnight. the ayutthaya tour we had a 6:15-6:30am call time, driver picked us almost at 7am, dropped at a location to join a tour bus, then departed to ayutthaya almost 9am - felt it was too early then we had to wait for more than an hour to start the tour.

Room needs a bit updating, clean but obviously old.","Good location especially if you’re on a shopping trip - has a free one way shuttle to Siam discovery, and only a few minutes walk to pratunam, platinum and krung thong malls. on evenings, night market is only across the entrance. The vicinity has a lot of restaurants to choose from but are mostly Indian, tho we also found some Vietnamese, Thai and Filipino after walking along farther.

Easy to book airport service, though our pick up driver instructed us to enter with our big luggages through the stairs only to find out that there’s a ramp on the opposite side.

We had to cut our trip a day short and they were very accommodating to let us refund the one night.

International dinner buffet on Bangkok balcony was amazing! The breakfast also had a lot to choose from but nothing unusual.

Good,"During the check-in the front desk asked a 3000 THB deposit (not unusual) but they insisted that unless it's paid in CASH it would take up to three months to get the money back. This caused long delays during the check-in and understaffed front desk didn't really help. 
Rooms were also quite dated and there was never very hot water in the shower.
Lots of visitors to top floor restaurants and observation deck sharing the lifts with hotel guests meant that getting to your room or out to street level always takes a lot of time and lifts are crowded.",The hotel is all about city views which definitely were great from a high floor room and from the rotating rooftop observatory deck.,7.0,December 2022,"December 12, 2022",Junior Suite Sky Zone,2,Solo traveler,7.7,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0.0010002262107572388
Not what it used to be,"Rooms getting tired.
Queuing 20 minutes on a Saturday just to get the lift to my room.
Restaurant closes at 9.30pm on a Saturday, so no entry after 8.45pm. I've never been to any major city with a policy like this.
This area is now catering to a predominantly Indian market, which is evident by the dozens of Indian restaurants in the immediate area and not one single Thai restaurant.

"Wonderful staff, incredible views, good value for money and fantastic location.",,"I had a one night stopover in Bangkok on a flight between Paris and Melbourne, and chose this hotel as it was mentioned in an article I found on the internet. Bangkok is huge, I hadn't been for a while and I wanted somewhere nice but reasonably priced and easy to get to.. I knew I'd be tired after the flight from France. It's the tallest or one of the tallest (?) buildings in the city. This hotel is very close, just a little walk, from the SkyTrain station. It was busy, and obviously popular which is always a good sign - and has a skydeck so or course people can visit without having to actually be a guest in the hotel. The hotel itself is big and spacious and the staff were patient, professional and kind. I had a late flight on to Melbourne, which was a while after checkout, and so I wasn't quite sure what to do.. as it was summer I knew I'd be a hot and sweaty mess from walking around during the day and didn't want to get on the flight like that! Not to worry.. even though I'd checked out - when I came back to pick up my bags, the hotel very kindly let me use the swimming / spa area for a quick shower and freshen up before continuing my journey! (Hot tip, it would have been smarter to then take a cab to the airport as of course it was so hot I was still a sweaty mess after walking to the train and travelling in that way! Quite funny! but nice to be able to freshen-up regardless).

This Hotel has a marvellous view from all levels, and well worth going up to the very top if you have time - the deck rotates around the tower! The breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and generous, with all sorts of delicious food and a beautiful view out the windows across Bangkok. I thought this hotel was a lot of fun, easy to get to, good value for money and perfect for what I needed. I'm glad I discovered it and I'd be very happy to stay there again.",8.0,July 2022,"August 9, 2022",Special Offer - Deluxe Double or Twin Room Sky Zone,1,Solo traveler,7.7,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.000997713408156216

Very Good,"There was a couple of things I did not really like about the property. 
1. The elevator situation, in hindsight I should have thought about it before booking into a hotel like this, but it was not ideal, as sometimes you could be waiting up to 5 minutes for an elevator because there are so many levels and so many different people coming to restaurants or sky decks and other facilities. 
2. Our toilet blocked multiple times and ended up flooding, when staff came into clean it they were treating us like we were dumb for not knowing that you aren’t supposed to flush toilet paper down the toilet and advised us that we were supposed to wipe and then put that dirty toilet paper in the rubbish which is a bit odd.

nice view but expected more quality and service for that price,"We booked a room for 3 people (me, my partner & child (8)) but at the check-in they told us that we have to pay 1000 THB per day extra for the extra bed. Furthermore the staff was not able (for the whole stay) to bring us 3 towels to the room. And if you wanted to call the reception to bring one extra towel they didn't pick up the phone or you have to do this 3 times (during a time for 3 hrs) or go down to the lobby personally to get your things. 

The opening hours of some bars are strange. At the front door it is written that the bar is open till 10 pm but than it is already closed at 7 pm. 

On the first view the room is clean but we found 2 cockroaches in the bathroom. The room and the corridor is smelling strange (old and wet ... similar as on an harbour). 

The prices are very high. If you want to book a taxi to the airport via hotel you have to pay 1000 THB. If you go outside (there are plenty taxis and a taxi station) you pay only 500 THB.

To go up to the different floors per elevator is a little bit difficult because there is so much traffic and sometimes you have to wait 5 minutes to get an available elevator.

"Great experience, I'll gladly stay here again and wholly recommend it to fellow travellers!","Well, the interior is perhaps a little tired and could use an uplift in the future. Also, facilities in general were quite modest or even basic, but certainly adequate. Nothing really to complain about, it's just probably that my expectations were a bit too high given the perceived prestige of one of the tallest skyscrapers of Bangkok. And to be fair, let's not forget that it's hard times for them too with C-19. All in all I had a great stay and will book here again in the future.

Sorry to mention that I probably won't choose this hotel for my next visit to Bangkok.,"1) The rooms are run-down, not well kept.  Can't bare foot on the carpets as it'll caused feet itchiness.
2) No door bell, we have to knock several times for our kids to response. 
3) It seems that there's someone kept knocking our doors & windows (both rooms) in the middle of the night (every night) and we can't see anyone through the peephole.  Couldn't rest well due to disturbed nights.

Great experience but do not pay for breakfast if you want good veg meals one can access them just within 80m from the pr,"The breakfast menu is very wide spread yet it has limited options for Indian veg meals everything has egg even appam which is a pure veg traditional South Indian dish.

"Stay away, better to book some modern small hotel","1. Very old. 
2. Very poor light in the room and especially in the bathroom, you feel like in the cellar.

Not worth the money,"Overcrowded, overpriced and understaffed. Staff unfriendly and avoid eye contact. Difficult to find any Thai or European food nearby, mostly only Indian restaurants. Ridiculous elevator system, resulting in often queuing for a lift.

"Overall, I won't recommend my stay on this hotel customer service.","I had two unpleasant experiences with staff.

I booked two same price rooms.  The first room is okay but the second one was cramped and had an unpleasant smell.  I asked to change the 2nd room.  Receptionist, Juntinuch changed the room to a room which is small and had same unpleasant smell. While I was inspecting this room, one staff on that flood showed me the room next to that which is the same as the first room.  I told this to Jintinuch and she got irritated and phoned that staff and was speaking on her own language.  She told me that if I want that room that I have to pay extra (which I cannot understand because it was the same size room of the first one that I booked). After some time, she said she can give same size room but 8 floors away.  I said my companion who is elderly does not want this.  I ended up just staying in that cramped room wishing I book somewhere else.  
Another incident: My family were waiting for the elevator and the kitchen staff, named Mangkalawut who was pushing a trolley shouted and hand gestured.  We gave him way so he can go to the lift first.  He shouted again, hold a specific lift and lectured us that  said we should have waited there.  We said okay but he should stop shouting.  He shouted again, so we said if he won't stop, we will report him.  Then he said ‘no food for you’.  I reported to the manager and he said that he would talk to him but have not heard any thing after that. This incident upset our group and dampen the birthday celebration we were having.

Cleaning service: On our second day, new towels were replenished but they left the old towels in the floor.  There were insects in the toilet.",the location of the place is central/ accessible to transport.,3.0,January 2023,"January 6, 2023",Superior Double or Twin Room,3,Group,7.7,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0.0009217984463856133
Don’t reccomend staying here,"I would not stay here again! This hotel is super busy 24/7 as it’s a tourist attraction. The hotel is too over crowded. To get to your room that you are staying in you have to take multiple lifts to get here. The breakfast was not nice, did not like the food. 
The hotel bar is too busy and they don’t take your order for drinks. 
The rooms are very out dated and have a very bad smell of sewage coming from them. 
The shower head is too low down to fit under it, and you can not take down the shower head to hold. We had to bend down to fit under the shower. 
The staff were not helpful, all other hotels we stayed in across Thailand were so helpful with organising day trips and always done a good price.

See above and I could not recommend this hotel to anyone!!,"Well were were given a bonus of honeymoon sweet, however, it was just another room. This hotel looks as if it has not been touched in decades. It has a dated or outdated interior. In our room the lighting is very poor and why are you still not using LED light to add more light, Even the bathroom was dull with old worn out taps waiting 5+ minutes for hot water to flow and we had the daily experience of walking into the bathroom to be greeted with the smell of raw sewerage. These facilities may suit a large number of Indian tourists as they are coming from a subcontinent but not today's Westerners!  No one should have to put up with that bathroom smell. On a positive note, the staff was good the restaurant food was good the breakfast was overcrowded rush to find a seat,",My wife and I stayed the the hotel for our honeymoon.

Very Poor,"The room was nice but very old. The whole building need renovation.
The elevator system is weird, need to jump from one elevator to another to get to the rooftop.
If you want to book this place only because of the view, then its a bad idea.

The pool is one of the baddest where I was, no wonder there was no one... no pool bar, no views despite that the pool was on the 20 floor.

It’s ok for a short stay but will not book again because of the quality of service and rooms.,The decor of the restaurant is very outdated. There is a smell of old carpet. The breakfast was less than average and the juices were too sweet. My mom is diabetic and there’s not a lot of choices for her to drink apart from water and coconut water. The bathroom has an awful odour from the drainage. The carpet smelled horrible. Some of the staff are friendly but I supposed it’s a busy hotel so most of the staff at reception are not friendly at all. The taxis in front normally rip you off so it’s a constant haggle for prices. There aren’t a lot of choices of restaurants nearby - most of them were Indian restaurants.

Good,The hotel is outdated and in dire need of refurbishment.

Unfriendly staff and expensive for a hotel that needs renewal.,"We booked a room for 2 adults and a child with 3 years old. Of course as a married couple we asked for a double bed. 
When we arrived we were told that there is only 2 single beds available. 
No solution proposed by the hotel, only „bad luck“.
As there was not even a child bed or something we had to ask for a paid upgrade in order to get the same room with double bed in a higher floor. 

For us a real NoGo if we book with 3 to get 2 single beds. The upgrade should have been proposed without additional payment and asking by us. 

In addition to that, the hotel is very old and should be renewed. The shower was very poor, the windows dirty (no good view) and as we wanted to have dinner there was no table left, even that we are hotel guests.
