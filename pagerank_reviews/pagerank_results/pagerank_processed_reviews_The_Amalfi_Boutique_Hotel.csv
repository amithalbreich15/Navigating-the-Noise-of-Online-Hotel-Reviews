Great Loction,"The bathroom windows need blinds as everyone walking past can see in when the light is on. The tea and coffee station in room only had milk and 2 sugar sachets but no tea or coffee and nothing to wash or dry dishes with. Elevator smelled like a garbage bin.

"Great staff, great location, spacious room but facilities were old and poor.","The facilities in the room were told and ragged. The bed linen was good but the double bed was too tiny for me and my 9 year old daughter. The couch in the room was ragged from use, one of the floor tiles was broken, the reading lamp on my bedside only worked after much persuasion. I think the switch was too old. A slightly better quality and bigger rug in the room would have helped.","The staff -- every single one of them -- was fantastic. Friendly, helpful, efficient. It was useful to have the restaurant on the ground floor-- very nice vibe. The location was great in terms of all the tourist attractions. Lots of places to eat nearby.

Couple,"I didnt like the fact that they didn't do house keeping. The TV was a problem, cz it kept switching over to store mode while we were watching. I would've like a kitchen cloth.

Clean but dodgy,"The parking is a problem and on Saterday the security told us that there is no parking and that we should park in street because the owner of the Hotel was hosting a party we stated that we will not be parking in the street and will wait for a parking just so a car came to the gate to leave the premises and the security let us in just so we can discover that there is 6 parking spots open .

The Hotel is a bit old but everything is clean maintenance could also be sharpen a bit but that's still fine.

The biggest problem was a room that was linked to the parking lot that was a private room or space with tinted windows that looked a bit dodgy from the outside with guards standing at the entrance and attracting a lot of fancy cars at evening that took up the parking that gave quite a dodgy feeling to the whole place and not a nice experience would.

The air-conditioning dit not work properly either . And the photos that you see is outdated it was taken when everything was new but things are a bit used at this point.",The place was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful.

Exceptional,"There wasn't a mop in the bathroom to clean up after ourselves. Not sure if that is a maintenance job or if we had to request one... but would have preferred to have a mop in the apartment just to dry up the floor after taking a shower.

Also, a dish cloth to wash up after we used all the utensils. There was just a dry cloth. Not sure if I wasnt looking correctly or if this also had to be requested. Felt bad to leave the kitchen in that state and not being able to wash the dishes properly.","I loved how your staff were easily willing to help me move to a room that had the balcony facing the main street!

Beware... the photos of the ultra cool lobby have nothing to do with the rooms. They need to be gutted and updated to match the vibe that's being sold. Currently The Amalfi hotel is a slight step-up from some of the backpackers hotels I've come across while travelling in my early 20's.

Great location! it worked for what I needed and I was glad that it had a back up generator for work,"When we arrived, we were put in a tiny room for three people that didn‚Äôt even have enough beds so we had to be split into two rooms for the first night and then the second night they put an extra bed in one of the rooms and then the third night they put us in the room we paid for (We stayed for two weeks) at least they sorted it out but it did take a couple days and they did not offer any refund. The noise and smell of the garbage was horrendous on garbage day, It was a little better once we moved to the third floor. I wish the kitchen had a one plate stove and a frying pan. It would‚Äôve saved a lot of eating out but the toaster and microwave did help a little little bit but the meals got boring after a while and I had to eat out.
Make sure you know what you‚Äôre paying for at the restaurant downstairs. Someone tried to charge in pocket the money for two green juices, and when I called them out on it, they quickly gave me the money back. Out of the three rooms that I stayed in in my three weeks, the last room was the best, but the key card for the room did not work for both locks so I had to carry around the card in the key at all times and I was worried about losing it the entire time.","Location was great!

Good,"the hotel needs a serious make over. I can understand that the last 3 (covid) years were tough and there was probably not enough money but the rooms need some renovation, tiles are broken, lamp shades are old and stained, free cables are hanging around (TV, telephone, wifi), rubber seals in bathroom (under glass door in the shower) were full of mould and need to be replaced, sofa bed was completely scratched and old and doesn't look nice...
unfortunately I had the diesel generator just under my balcony so I could smell the diesel exhaust and it was loud. my room was facing the sea side, the rooms to the other side (street side) might be also loud due to the very busy Regent Street (traffic and people/ restaurants/ supermarkets etc). so as long as load shedding in South Africa is going on there is obviously no proper solution for which I do not blame the hotel, they're trying their best to keep electricity 24/7!","very helpful and friendly staff, checked me in earlier which I highly appreciated, big rooms, good beds and blankets, enough space to keep a suitcase open while rooming around. enough kitchen space for preparing cold food but even a toaster and microwave were available. balcony is a plus. wifi worked very well, very lively area with lots of restaurants and shops, boutiques and supermarkets and 7 minutes by foot away from Sea Point Beach Rd and the beaches. no power outages (""load shedding"" in local language) due to diesel generator. restaurant (Jarryds) just downstairs which serves very good food the whole day and closes only by 22:00.

Pleasant,The bathrooms have mould on the roof and the partition in the bath is coming off and has mould around the silicone. The key card didn't work all the time.  Not the hotels fault but I had a very noisy neighbor who made noise until 1am.  The light bulb on the bedside blew and the wires are dangerously positioned across the front of the bedside tables.  It would also be nice to get a remote for the parking gate. We always have to wait for someone to open and it can take a while. One of the staff came at 20h00 to load prepaid electricity.

It was amazing in the rooms but the facility wasn't the best.,"I am not a picky person, but there were a few things that really turned me off:

* We found in total 3 insects in the room, of which were a daddy long legs spider, a cockroach and a fish moth. They all appeared in the bathroom.
* This is not something that the hotel can change, but having being located right next to a popular restaurant makes things a little socially awkward. Especially given that you're having to walk past customers ALL the time when you're leaving and entering.
* The lifts had a really funky smell every time we entered it.","I loved the friendly staff and the overall location of the hotel as it was near many stores and very close to a lot of activities hubs. I really enjoyed having the comfort of our own balcony as well with our room,

The most frightening night in any hotel,"On our last night, the guest next door to us came back late. We heard an altercation outside. We heard him then smash up his room and scream obscenities. We called security as we were scared. He implied he was a long term resident and had been mugged coming to his room. After security left he spent a few hours ranting and making threats to us through the blinds in our room: they are so poor we could see his face. We did not know if he had a gun or would force his way in. Why did security imply it was us who called, putting us at risk? We have never been so scared.
1) If the man next to us was mugged in the hotel, what on earth were security doing? Clearly it is not safe for visitors if this is happening.
2) Given his behaviour in any case, why wasn't he removed from the premises until he was calm?
3) Management in the morning didn't seem in any way concerned. In the UK, we would have been offered a full refund and a formal apology at least.

"Fine to store your luggage, but no boutique hotel.","-Very outdated rooms with old furniture, broked floor tiles, stains everywhere (curtains, walls, table lamps) and very very musty and moldy bathrooms. 
-Beds way too short for Europeans: 188 cm. 
-Very noisy rooms and walls. Located on a lively street, so be aware when booking/checking in and your room is located at the front of the building. 
Especially on the first floor (rooms 106 and 107), they are based above Ariel restaurant. Amazing Italian place I can recommend, but impossible to sleep above.
After telling about the noise nuissance we got the chance to move rooms.
But unfortunately the new room was a downgrade; a smaller room (which is fine), including a smaller bed (140x188cm) with less furniture (especially way less wardrobe). A malfunctioning aircondioning. Missing blinding curtains. And a small regular tv instead of a smart tv. (least of my concerns). 
But at least we got less noise and a few proper nights of sleep. 
This hotel is fine if you are looking for a very basic place to store your luggage for a few nights. Not for 2,5 weeks.
It is definitely not a boutique hotel, where you not only expect a amall hotel on a prime location, but also unique personality and decor, personalized service, and a local flair. And a bit more luxury, like it appears on the ground floor (restaurant, shop and reception). 
I think the photos of the rooms on google/booking/social media etcetera are taken from tactical angles. 
This place in in desperate need of a renovation. I would go back for the location, but only if the place got an extensive upgrade and meets the 2023 standards of a 3 star hotel.","+located nicely, nearby ocean, nice restaurants and bars and many convenient places

Great location by the beach and shopping,"The interior of the room was clean and nice, but lacked character. It was furnished and decorated in a very basic way.

Also, the elevator smelled really bad my entire stay. While checking out, one of the maintenance workers told me a bird had died in the elevator, so that may have been why. This was not the fault of the hotel but it would have been nice if something was done about it earlier.

Disappointing to say the least and this is the FIRST time ever that I am giving a bad review..,"If one compares the lobby to the so called hotel rooms, it was hugely disappointing. 
And to land up in room 213 was just gross.. poorly decorated.. was just gross and had to demand for another room.
The curtains is dirty and seams loose..
Twice our bed was either not made or we had to call housekeeping to have unit cleaned up and that was in afternoon.. We always leave early morning and come back late afternoons. Even the bathroom was not touched 1 day.. every thing was the same as we left it. And we ALWAYS leave a tidy room before going out..
The coffee cups was not washed Tuesday morning.. just rinsed and the coffee marks could still be seen and there was no cloth to wash dishes with.  No milk supplied with coffee or tea.
And that plastic carpet was the worst.. just terrible for a Hotel.
The only channel we could follow on tv was Youtube.. DSTV would start scrambling within 5 min.. we could not follow any programs.
Just a few changes can change the Hotel in a much more appealling way to compare with your Lobby..
We really did not enjoy our stay there.

Specifically booked this place for the secure parking for our rental car.

No toilet paper or mugs in the room.
Empty/used toiletry bottle on the floor of the bathroom when we arrived. Shower drain was also clogged.

Disappointing,"1. There were broken floor tiles in the bathroom.
2.With times, the cleaners didn't give us full bathroom towels. It was either 3 or 2 towels.
3. The geyser and plug thing was annoying. Meaning if the geyser is on, the plugs at the kitchen will not work. So the geyser had to be switched off and then the plugs will work.
4. There should be a kitchen cloth and a small dish washer soap in the kitchen.
5. The hotel entrance is inside the restaurant, so you had to go inside the restaurant where people are eating to get to the loft. Sooo uncomfortable.

Never Again,"My wife and her friend stayed at the Amalfi Boutique Hotel for only one night, luckily. However, I must say that it was the worst place I've ever stayed in while visiting Cape Town. I can't understand how it's rated as a 3-star hotel by the Tourism Grading Council of South Africa (TGCSA). In my opinion, it doesn't even deserve 1 star.

Firstly, my friend and I were given separate rooms on different floors, which was inconvenient as she couldn't access the third floor without me. The hotel's room allocation could have been better.

During my stay in Room 301, I encountered numerous issues, including a non-functional spare plug by the bed, a lack of a dressing table and chair, mold on the bathroom ceiling, missing bathroom shelf, and no toilet paper holder. The room had old and rusty bedside lamps and lampshades, with dirt on the skirtings, indicating the need for some maintenance and painting. The duvet provided was paper-thin and provided no warmth.

The curtains were badly fitted, stained, and disgusting. Despite the hotel being perceived as ""cheap"" or ""budget,"" it's no excuse for having dirty and poorly maintained guest rooms. (see images).

The only positive aspect was the hotel's location, but based on my experience, I will NEVER return to this hotel again.",Location,1.0,August 2023,"August 6, 2023",Suite with Balcony,1,Group,7.5,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.000811483038392464

Photos were deceiving.,"We were disappointed as the room was not the room we booked on bookings.com. The photos were deceiving, and the bed was a double bed, but they were advertised as a king bed. The room was supposed to be a balcony with a sea view. There is no view other than just buildings. We searched for a lot of accommodation, and we picked the room because of the photos, it was very miss leading. 
We also had no parking for our car and had to pay R220 per day just to park at Spar, which we are also only notified of after our booking. That was also very disappointing, I think for the amount of money we spend on Parking and the room we ""thought"" we were booking, we overpaid emensly and might just have well booked at a sea front hotel, as it would have cost us the same.",The location was great.,5.0,February 2024,"February 19, 2024",Suite with Balcony,5,Couple,7.5,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.000811483038392464

We do not recommend this venue.,"The room was very basic and dirty, the furnishing was poor.  The carpet had burnt holes in it.
The floor (tiles) were cracked and the pain on the walls were peeling.  
The kitchenette was appalling with extremely limited facilities.  It had a shelf in the most obscene place that served absolutely no purpose, other than us bumping into it continuously.
We also paid for a sea view, however we could only see a small strip if we happen to go out on the balcony.
The single bed is definitely not suitable for an adult and the duvet was too small. 
The loft room was very hot and stuffy with no air circulating, as the aircon downstairs did not cool the whole apartment.
We requested secure parking on booking, however when we got to the hotel we were advised that there is limited parking and it is allocated on a first-come first-served basis.

Unhappy client!!,"The fact that it's self catering but they don't have stoves in all 3 apartments. I asked for them to put 3 beds in one of the rooms as there were 3 boys sharing instead one of the boys had to sleep on a sleeper couch! The security gaurd kept asking are 7 of us are staying in one room that made it very uncomfortable for all of us as he kept asking the same question every day saying its Hes job!! My question is how do 7 people stay in one room?? The entrance to the apartments is very awkward as you need to keep walking through  the restaurant,  this was a very awkward place to stay at and we couldn't even braai on the balcony never again!! No Dstv or Netflix we have our own accounts but they should at least have 1 or the other! never again , everything  was awkward  there plus when my husband arrived with the kids they insisted that we had to pay in extra but the manager sorted it out.

Very dissapointing,"They could have been more considered and let us have the room when it was cleaned - as it was the first room to be cleaned - and not made as wait the full 3 hours until check in time, considering that we drove through the night and was beyond tired.  Staff should be accommodating and not spitefull.","We left Centurion 19:00 and drove through the night for the Netball Worldcup.   At 8:00 the next morning I phoned the hotel and requested an early check in.  They replied that the hotel was fully booked and I asked if we can have the first two available rooms to shower and maybe catch up on sleep before we had to depart for the games at 15:00.  The manager gave us 2 rooms on our arrival at 11:00.  The one room (202) was fairly nice - almost like the pictures on the web.  The other hotel room (214) was terrible and not even close to what we have booked.  I walked downstairs and showed the Manager the pictures and very politely informed him ""my friend this doesnt event look closed to the room we were expecting.  Can we please have another room?""  He said they were busy cleaning another room. and we agreed to wait.  That was about 11:20.  We were beyond tired.  I phoned them every 30 minutes and they had the same answer.  They are busy cleaning the room.  At 13:50 my partner walked up to the reception again and asked if th room is maybe available.  Although the room key was laying on the desk, the lady made him wait until exactly 14:00 to give him the room key.  They made us wait THREE hours with the excuse that they are busy cleaning the room.   When we asked the cleaning lady se said that was the first room she had cleaned - room 201.  Our whole trip starter wrong because of spitefull staff.  Our duvet was to small for the bed.  The bathmat had a huge whole in it,  The basin in the bathroom had no plug.

4. I mistakenly spilled makeup on the bedsheets in the morning,  when I came back I found the very same sheet unchanged.

5. the kitchen lights weren't working.

I had two very uneven single beds that were put together, I requested a double or king as I am 1.95 tall as this was not adequate but my request was not considered and I was not helped. On the second day seeing that the bed story was not going to be resolved, I  made a request for at least a bigger bedding and the duvet instead of the two small or singles and I was told that they will see what they can do and nothing was done. I left this alone, and finally, this is an old building however the building was not clean, there was grime between the pipes and on corners. To top it off I then killed a huge cockroach on the morning of the ladt day. This was disgusting for me. The lift had a very bad smell.

One of the best parts of my stay was the proximity to the beach. Being able to wander down to the shore whenever I wanted was such a treat. Whether it was soaking up the sun or taking a refreshing dip in the ocean, having the beach so close by was a definite highlight.

The bathroom tiles had black mold growing in the grouts. The shower head was fully covered with limescale and the bath tub was an unpleasant sight.

"Cockroaches, and smell, beware!","Cockroaches!!! And the place stenk on the 25th Dec when the restuarant was empty, clearly indicating the drains are filthy and they were smelling because there were not actively used on the day as there was no customer ot the restuarant on Christmas day. 

Everyday from the 23rd to 26th Dec  we saw a cockroach. I took a videos of these everyday. I complained on the 25th Dec  and the best I was offered was moving to another room. It is a complex; how is moving rooms gona help, i mean if you understand how roach infestation works so I refused with sighting that reason.

I made it clear I was not happy paying R1300 a night only to be greeted by roaches every day. If I didn't mind roaches I could have gone to a place that's charhing half the price, and far from waterfront. 

The manager said they'd get back to me before going home, that he needed to talk to his superiors, the following day he twisted the story saying I said I'd come back to him, when I corrected him he then said he'd offered moving rooms which I refused so there is nothing he could do.

1-there's no privacy at all so people passing our room can see our bathroom window and see everything inside.

2-every morning the sun is straight in our face because there's not enough cover for the window.

3-the unstoppable noise of the water running from the bathroom of the room next to us.

4-the hair on the bed sheets from the first night",1.0,October 2021,"October 25, 2021",Suite with Balcony,2,Couple,7.5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0.0004030598181054612
