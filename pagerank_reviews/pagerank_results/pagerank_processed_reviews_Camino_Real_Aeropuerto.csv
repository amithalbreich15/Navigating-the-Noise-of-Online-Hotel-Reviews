"Too expensive, convenient location for early flights.","The interior is very dated and the room was totally overpriced. It was the most expensive hotel of our whole Mexico trip, and while the room was ok, I wouldn't recommend staying there (except if you need access to the airport). 
Also, the hotel called us a taxi for a quick trip to the city. What should have been a 20min drive, turned into an hour of us constantly checking google maps to not get lost – the driver had no idea where he was going. Took him also 15min to get his credit card device working. We exited the taxi 2 blocks early cause we kept driving in circles in the wrong direction. Should have taken an official airport taxi instead of the hotel driver, would have also been slightly cheaper.","We stayed for one night because we had an overseas flight leaving very early in the morning.

A wonderful place to stay at the Mexico City airport -- once you manage to find it!,"I took a point off my overall score for this hotel because it was such a pain to find it after arriving by bus from Puebla. If I hadn't found such a good deal on the room, I would've deducted two points. It was bad.
In an effort to save the hotel future lost points and to help future guests, I will share my hard-won discoveries: You cannot see the hotel from inside the airport; from outside, you can see it once you get around Gate 5 and lower.... Do *not* follow the signs with an ""H"" or ""bed"" for ""Hotel""; they will take you to the Courtyard by Marriott (which must have been the only one to cough up money for the signage).... Do *not* rely on Google maps, which has let me down on a number of occasions during Covid and no more so than in this airport.... Only ask for directions from people in the Information booths; the other official-looking people are way too important and too busy talking to their friends to help a lost tourist.... When they tell you that the hotel is by Puerta 4, realize that this door is on the lower floor. To reach the hotel, you need to be on the upper/second floor, from where you cannot see the numbers. When they tell you on that floor that you need the second ""puerta"" on the right, realize that there are no doors/gates up there (except doors to offices and shops). There *are* two pedestrian overpass bridges (puentes), and the Camino Real Hotel is reached via the second one. That bridge is about 5-7 minutes past the one that leads to the airport train to Terminal 2; you will see a big letter ""B"" over on the left side just ahead. The second bridge splits. If you go left, you reach parking, and no one there has ever heard of the Camino Real Hotel. If you go right, you will see the first and one and only sign for the Camino Real Hotel. Walk across the bridge, keeping straight (there's a right turn into the airport outbound bus station) and you will enter the lobby...","I got a very good deal on my room here but would find this to be a really solid airport hotel even if I had paid the normal rate. My room was large, comfortable, and well serviced during my 2-night stay. The wifi (which was free with my rate) worked fine. Every staff member I encountered was cheerful and attentive. The soaring atrium lobby might be a bit outdated; decked out with a big Christmas tree and creche in the center, though, it was all quite festive and airy. It was relaxing to sit in the bar and have a couple of drinks while watching NFL games. I didn't eat there. (Yes, the prices were pretty high, but it is at a major airport. There are several good, more reasonable restaurants like Hector's Agavito within a one-block radius.) I also waited there with a tequila while waiting for the results of my Covid test, which was done at the medical office right next to the reservations desk. Although my flight back to Chicago left from Terminal 2, I stayed at this hotel at Terminal 1 (which can be a real nightmare) because of the great deal and because it is right next to a metro stop into the city (""Terminal Aérea"" station, Line 5). At 4:30 a.m., I only had to walk over to the terminal, down the escalator, and over to outside Gate 6 to catch the airport bus to Terminal 2 (20 pesos). The train (free) was just about to start up (at 5:00 a.m.), and it was even closer and at the same level.",8.0,December 2021,"January 18, 2022",Deluxe King,2,Solo traveler,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0007522539090887878
Perfect room without leaving the airport,"The hotel is quite big, but a little bit old-fashioned. The first floor (registration desk, lobby, restaurant, and bar) look nice when the rooms and the corridors are a bit 'oldish' probably because of the designs. The only thing missing in the room was a fridge.
The hotel is not that difficult to reach, but it would be much better if there would be some signs inside the airport when leaving the departure doors to understand in which direction to walk.","The hotel has an extremely comfortable location as it connected with the airport terminal. So all you need is to get your luggage, go to the second floor of the airport terminal and have 3-4 mins walk to get to the hotel lobby.
The room has an air conditioner, clean bed sheets, clean towels, wardrobe, safe box, TV and cot ready if you are travelling with children.
On the other hand, there is a gym, restaurant, travel office, store and even the post box, so you can send a Mexican postcard directly from the hotel.
And the last thing to keep in mind is that sometimes there are queues for the check-in, probably it happens when multiple flights arrive at the same time. In this case, the check-in process will take longer, but the hotel staff works quite fast, so surely you will get your room as soon as possible. However, the check-out process is super fast, so you would not need to be worrying about missing your flight.",9.0,February 2022,"April 14, 2022",Deluxe King,1,Family,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0.0007520939602056682

Fair,"Very noisy at the reception area. You could hear everything from our room which did not let us sleep until later. This is quite ironic given that you could not hear a plane take off or land but you could hear everything from within the hotel.

A lot of unnecessary stress at arrival.,"Hated the carpet in the room.  I would prefer hard flooring for sanitary purposes.  The Ballet person was not at the front of the hotel when we arrived with our rental car and lots of luggage.
There was not enough space at the front to park the car to wait for a Ballet person.  We drove the car into the parking lot used by the hotel but not owned by the hotel and could only be Ballet parked.  There was no one to help with the luggage.  We were told to drive back to the front of the hotel.  It was a very stressful and unorganized situation.  We did not want to park the car in Ballet because we just needed to unload the luggage into our room and then return the car to the rental office.  
A hotel sign is needed we’re one must turn to find the hotel.

The price has double since I started staying here a couple of years ago. Not worth the price.  
There was no coffee maker in the room and breakfast is not included, and the restaurant Huerta, was not very good either.

Fair,We had to take a taxi to the hotel from terminal 2 because no one could tell us how to get there.  There is a train that runs from terminal 2 to 1 but it’s challenging to find. From terminal 1 it’s an easy walk over the catwalk. The rooms in the 2nd tower were older and worn and I don’t think worth the price. Breakfast was fine but overpriced. I would NOT walk around outside!,The location is great if you arrive in terminal 1; if you arrive in terminal 2 it is very difficult to find the first time.  We stayed one night in a very nice room and the 2nd night in a different tower that was very worn and challenging to get to.

It's conveniently located at the terminal and a great option for overnight stays at the airport.,"Even though we stayed in a newly renovated room, your matresses are still old and uncomfortable.

You are starting to renovate the rooms which is a plus.,7.0,August 2023,"August 15, 2023",Superior Double Room,1,Couple,8,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0.000722802621527675
High expectations - High price - Dissapointing experience.,"I would like to state, that my observations here are not intended to hurt or speak ill of the hotel, this are just pointers that I think that management could take a look at in order to improve and make the guests' stay more pleasant.
Cleanliness is strongly lacking in the rooms. The first room that we were accommodated in (Tower 2) was not clean. Since you can not open the windows in this hotel to let in some fresh air, we could smell dust and humidity in the air, slightly moldy. At a closer look, we found layers of dust on the carpet, which makes us assume that vacuuming was thoroughly done. The bathroom again, showed signs of wear and lack of proper cleaning. The shower head had lime accumulation and you can find mold forming on the crevices of the bathtub and other areas in the bathroom. Since we suffer from allergies we got accommodated in a new room in Tower 1, which was larger and had more natural light coming in through the window. Unfortunately the situation was just slightly better, but to my surprise, when I turned on the A/C to have some fresh air pumped into the room, it just made things worst. You could breathe in the dust and humidity, probably from old filters. Nevertheless I turned the A/C off immediately after a minute or so. 
Be aware of two things, live music is played downstairs in the restaurant and can go on until 10:00pm which, for a tired traveler, might not be the ideal sleeping situation. Also, there is no menu for room service. In Mexico City, drinking tap water is not recommended. I was shocked to find out that a one liter bottle of drinking water costs 100$ mxn at the hotel. If it is not too late, I recommend going to the Oxxo store at Terminal 1 and buy one bottle for 23-25$ mxn.
So, in short, for +125€ for a one night stay for two persons, I sincerely do not recommend staying here, unless you have no other option, or your flight leaves very early in the morning the next day.","First impression when coming in, the hotel looks really nice. It has a huge inner courtyard and the rooms are arranged around it, at least the ones from Tower 1. It is open 24/7 and you can make the check in easily when you come in. Also, the COVID security measures were followed during our stay, which made us feel more comfortable.
Two things that stand out the most are, the staff and the location. We had a couple of issues with our room and the staff was more than willing to help us out and accommodate us in a different room.
The beds have fresh sheets and are comfortable which allow for a good night sleep.
The location is unbeatable when you have a connecting flight the next day. The hotel facilities are connected and open 24/7 to Terminal 1. If your flight leaves or arrives at Terminal 2, the hotel has a free shuttle service from and to the terminal every 15-20 mins. Just make sure to ask in the front desk in case you are in a rush.

Would like to stay again for location but we don't fully trust giving credit card info to this hotel,"We booked a decent rate through booking.com and a couple of days before had a very worrying fraudulent email message supposedly direct from the Camino Real hotel via booking.com messages asking for credit card details via a link.  We were given 12 hours to give this info or they would cancel our room!  Booking.com internal messaging system messages take 24 hours to respond so we had no choice but to make sure this reservation was still secured.  In the end we called the hotel who were then alerted of this problem.  At check in we did not even feel comfortable giving a credit card as we felt their system had been compromised.
Room:  Sufficiently large enough.  However, there were not enough towels in the room for two occupants.  The room was supposed to be a quiet one, but we were right near a very steep hallway ramp which was super loud when guests left their rooms very early with luggage.  
The food and drink choices on site were ok but very expensive for the quality.",The location is the main reason why we chose this hotel.

The hotel is not that difficult to reach, but it would be much better if there would be some signs inside the airport when leaving the departure doors to understand in which direction to walk.","Camino Real Aeropuerto is an excellent choice for travelers passing through Mexico City's airport. The hotel's location is extremely convenient, as it is directly connected to the airport terminal. All you need to do is grab your luggage and take a quick 3-4 minute walk to the hotel lobby. The rooms are well-appointed, featuring air conditioning, clean bed sheets and towels, a wardrobe, safe box, TV, and even a cot for traveling families. The hotel also offers a variety of amenities including a gym, restaurant, travel office, store, and even a post box, so you can send a Mexican postcard directly from the hotel. On my previous stay, the rooms were a bit dated, but the hotel has recently undergone a big renovation and now all the rooms feel fresh and new.

Better off at terminal bench,"The staff are terrible and rude. Firstly, when we came, we arrived two days early as we departed our state to escape a blizzard we arrived at the hotel to request two additional days prior to our reservation. They would not accommodate at a similar rate, and wanted to charge us 300 more a night at $460, so we found the booking through hotels.com and got a better rate. Then we talked to the lady at the desk to have her merge our reservations so that we wouldn’t be locked out of our room on Friday the day of our original booking after returning from a tour, we found our rooms locked out And the staff were very rude and it took a while to fix the situation. Additionally, the air-conditioning does not work in this hotel and when I went to ask the hotel front desk for a Band-Aid they suggested I walk 20 minutes to the terminal to buy a Band-Aid they weren’t going to give me one. They did not have any sort of medical supplies, nor do they care to use them or provide their customers With any sort of comfort or support. We walk to the terminal and Starbucks gladly gave us a free Band-Aid. I can’t believe how rude insensitive, messy, uncomfortable and horribly unorganized this hotel is.

Mediocre,"Well, where do I begin? When I booked my room? I booked it with a city view which was good because it looked at over the airport so I could see planes taking off and landing which was nice but we did ask for a larger room and we were only given a really small room. The room number was 8140 but I must admit the bed was very comfortable and I did sleep very well, but we were there for two nights and on both occasions we had breakfast in the morning in the executive lounge and the breakfast was absolutely disgusting. The food that was meant to be hot was really cold and all you had for options for hot food in executive lounge was omelette that was overcooked and cold refried beans and pancakes and all the rest was cold stuff like ham, cheese, fruit and pastries so for the money I paid for this hotel was absolutely disgusting but we do love the hotel for its location and everything else but it needs to be upgraded in the executive lounge",The only thing I liked about this hotel was the location from the airport which meant I did not have to travel far when I had my flight and the gentleman who was on the executive floor lounge in the evening was a very nice guy.

Would not stay here again,"To start with, there are no signage inside the airport directing you to the hotel, had to find my own way by asking around.
Incredibly disappointed with staff. Witnessed a porter asked an oriental looking lady if she wanted help with her luggage, She did not respond (probably because she does not speak Spanish), and then the porter proceeded to make fun of her calling her derogatory names in Spanish, and 3-4 other porters laughed out loud! incredible rude and uprofessional. 
Next, there is an open yard in the courtyard, There was a guy clearly intoxicated and being obnoxious. Why did the bar staff let him get to this degree of intoxication?
Since the courtyard is open, noise carries to rooms, It is not relaxing to hear loud music and laughter past midnight

Disgusting￼,"well where to begin??? after booking three months in advance and as we have been to this hotel many times we always book a room with a city view looking over the airports in the mountains and the room is always a big room but on our first visit to our first room it was really small and you could not even have a view you could not see anything except the car park and when we went up to our second room it was a two bedded room with no view and then they put us in a room with two beds also but in a more expensive room and when we walked in and out of the room there was plaster and dirt all over the floor to the entrance of the room so all in all this trip what is the most terrible experience we have had from this hotel in previous visits it has been really nice but this is the worst and we also had 
and we also ate in the restaurant for breakfast and lunch and I can honestly say without any shadow of a doubt it was disgusting it was tasteless it was uninviting it was cold and we paid 900 pesos for breakfast the only thing that was okay well reasonably okay was the fruit but that wasn’t much good anyway I had watermelon and it was all a mush in the bowl they put it in The only thing that was hot when I had it on my plate what is the waffles which I had with cream and maple syrup The coffee was lukewarm and the green juice tasted burnt and tasted of nothing all you could taste was bitter ingredients 
So all in all a very very disappointing visit even though we go there on a regular basis but I think we will start going to another hotel in the airport when I arrive",well to be honest with you after being moved three times the bed was comfortable but that was about it,1.0,June 2022,"June 30, 2022",Deluxe King,2,Couple,8,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0.0005143827716662789

Our room had seen better times,"When we arrived, the room was clean, but it is evident that it has not been upgraded in a while, especially the bathroom. For example, the toilet was evidently old and there where not typical appliances such as hair dryer. Considering the price per night, I would expect it to be more ""new"" and equipped.   
Despite being an airport hotel, the restaurants are closed until 6 am. It would be convenient if they opened earlier. You can order room service at any time if you have to leave early and want to eat something before leaving the hotel, but the prices are quite high.
We stayed for 2 nights, and in most hotels you'd expect that someone comes to clean after the first night, but when we came back in the afternoon it was clear that no one had come. It was not a big issue for us because it was only one day and of course we did not have a mess, but that is not what you should expect for in a high quality hotel.","Very well located for travelers.

Awful,"I arrived with my sister and my mother at the Camino Real Hotel on February 14, 2024, to celebrate my mother 81st birthday which was February 14, 2024. We planned to visit the Basilica of our Lady of Guadalupe for the 3 days we were in Mexico since it has always been my mother’s desire to visit. I elected to stay at the Camino Real property which was located right next to the airport by Terminal 1 because I thought it would be extremely convenient and would be easier for my mother as far a long-distance travel was concerned. However, this proved to be a mistake with unfortunate consequences for my family. Upon arrival to the property around 4:30 -5:00 PM, we were greeted well by the front desk person (male). I specifically explained that I was traveling with my elderly mother for her birthday, and I politely ask for a quiet room on the property. The young man who checked us in assured us that the room he was assigning us (room 5115) would be comfortable and quiet. This proved to be misleading because, that night at about 8:00 P.M. an extremely loud street party began. The music was so loud that the walls in the hallway vibrated. The hallway and our room sounded like we were in the inside of a speaker. We could see the main stage from outside our room window as will as the moving spotlight which would pass by the window in our room. Not to mention the constant loud voice over the speaker of the announcer who was the mater of ceremony during the event. This loud noise lasted until 3:00 A.M.

I went down to the front desk and asked to speak with the manager on duty; I stated that the situation was unacceptable and that we needed another room and a quit one as we had requested and had been promised when we had checked in. I was told that they did not have any control over the street party and that there was nothing they could do. I insisted that this was not an acceptable reply.

A disaster. Place needs gutting and a full renovation; staff need to be trained in customer service.,See above.,"Other than the hotel was across a skywalk from the airport, nothing was acceptable.

They finally moved me although the desk was surly about it and dragged their feet on doing it. Second room was likewise terrible and it stank even more. I checked out at 3:30 AM because the smell was activating my asthma. I'd woken up with a blinding headache that left me dizzy.

mediocre,"well, when I made the booking, it said on the booking confirmation that the hotel would charge me the money before I arrived in the hotel, but when speaking to a member of staff, they told me that I would need to be in the hotel in person when arriving, so this hotel needs to get its reservations sorted out so customers do not get any problems when arriving
so all in all the hotel was nice, but the reservations area needs to be sorted and also I did book the junior suite with city view and on my last few occasions of going to this hotel. I have had a room looking over the airport due to this situation that occurred. On this occasion. I think I will be going to another hotel , I know it’s a little bit more expensive, but hopefully I’ll get better treated than I have done this time all in all not a great experience, but fellow TripAdvisor is I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and take care of yourself",it was close to the airport,3.0,December 2022,"December 15, 2022",Junior Suite,1,Couple,8,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0.0004007901403576395
Terrible scary experience !!!,"Hi,
Very disappointing and scary experience I had last night when staying in the hotel, I would not stay in this place again. Please see my review below

Early in the morning I heart I massive noice by the bathroom just before I was getting up to take a shower to get ready for my plane. What was my surprise that when I get in the bathroom part of the ceiling Had fallen down in the floor. It was part of the thick layer of pain plus some concrete (please refer to my pictures below).
If I would have gone earlier to take shower, this could have ended up in a massive and serious situation for myself, accident!!!

I immediately called the reception so I could have another room to take shower as I was taking a plane couple of hours after.

When I went down to the reception to check out, I don’t feel they really take this seriously and address the issue in the best way as they only apologised and they mentioned that another room was offered to just take shower. This is a hotel that I paid £100 per night? I would have expected that the manager would came and talked to me, but didn’t happen. The service was good, I have to leave cause of my plane. They took just my email address and mentioned they will contact me. I believe this a serious issue that could have ended up in a terrible accident. 
The rooms are not well maintained and look very old. Please check all rooms and give some maintenance so other guest are safe!

Over-all a good experience,"What I am very very dissapointed at: I had to wait for more than an hour for the hotel free shuttle bus. This while up to two times the employee in the airport office told me the shuttle would be coming in 10-15 minutes. When the shuttle arrived I mentioned again the shuttle was late. No apologies from the chauffeur and no explanation. I also mentioned it at the counter when checking in. Again no apologies. No courtesy. When you arrive after a pretty long travel and that is the first experience with the hotel and related services, that first impression is terrible. Note: During the ride with the shuttle bus I could conclude traffic was no excuse for the delay. When the information would be: it can take up to an hour. Than you know and can make the decision whether you are willing to wait for that time. Or that you  are prepared to spend some money and take another form of transport to the hotel.","Over-all a good experience.

"rooms good, service bad, be aware of price changes according your bookings as they might not be righ","The hotel is located at Terminal 2 for International flights. I had to take a very early flight at 6 AM at Terminal 1 (National Flights) and the free train shuttle that takes you there was not available till 5 AM. Noting that the train shuttle takes 15 minutes to transport you from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1 for national flights and another 15 minutes including check-ins plus standing in line for early national flights, I would not have made it. I had to take a bus transfer which cost me 20 MXN pesos, which I did not anticipate but had to run to catch it on time as only 1 bus drove during the early hours. Otherwise, it was waiting another 30 minutes for catching the next, which would have cost me losing my flight.

So the transportation from the hotel and airport should have been different if the hotel would have offered me a free ride at my disposal to be on time at check-in and the Terminal 1. They did not offer anything nor free rides. Or they did not inform me about that.

Also, they tried to trick me on my reservation and charged me much more than I reserved for, suddenly the price was 153 US Dollars a night but I booked for 136 US Dollars. After arguing with the clerk and showing a reservation by phone he admitted he made a mistake.  They try every time the same trick to convince you the price has been changed due to whatever, I had a similar situation 2 years ago with the same hotel, so be aware.","Camino Real is accessible directly from the airport which is recommendable for travelers on international flights, hence that is why they are located at the international arrival terminal 1.
