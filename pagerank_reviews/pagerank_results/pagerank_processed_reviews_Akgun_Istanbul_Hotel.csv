Shabby room but clean and comfortable anyway,"The furnishings and decor are very very old, tired and a little shabby. The main entrance lobby is nice, but the room was quite disappointing, it clearly hasn't been decorated for a very long time. The sheets and towels very old and well used - I actually enjoy scratchy towels but it's not what I was expecting from a 5-star hotel. The spa was comfortable but again really in need of redecoration - it had been visibly patched up a few times, the relaxing chairs upholstery was peeling off etc. Also the hotel is on a very major 6-lane road and it was noisy day and night.","The staff were lovely and the hotel was very clean. The breakfast was really excellent - great variety, everything was plentiful, tasty and good quality. The room was a really good size, and the view from up on the 7th floor out across the whole city was great.",7.0,November 2023,"November 22, 2023",Deluxe Single Room,7,Solo traveler,9,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.001351979074521943

An absolute pleasure and would definitely return.,It was a bit far away from the centre (taxis were quite expensive when there was traffic) and the noise from the traffic was quite loud as we were in a room on the front of the hotel (although it didn‚Äôt stop us sleeping in all fairness).,"The rooms were very clean and spacious, the restaurants were lovely (the sky bar had fantastic views) and the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help.

Grand and hospitable hotel experience!,"An overall good experience, but there there four areas below which I would have expected of a 5 star hotel:
- The decor of the rooms were a little tired and could be updated to become more modern. The main lobby is very grand and nice though.
- No outdoor food is allowed to be brought into the hotel to be consumed (maybe due to security reasons?)
- The room's amenities were not fully restocked daily, which meant that we had to request via guest services
- Bathroom not fully soundproof with neighbouring rooms and also did not have a toilet brush. Hairdryer is old and very very loud.","Overall a positive experience, safe hotel, good location near public transport and enjoyed the hospitality of the hotel.

- Check in was smooth with bags taken straight from taxi to rooms
- Staff were friendly and happy to help, guest relations at reception for help and WhatsApp communicated to check in
- Hotel accommodated our needs to have two rooms next to each other on same floor which was really helpful
- Hotel provided complimentary breakfast upgrade which was a nice surprise and had a good variety. Mix of Continental and Turkey breakfast with plenty of space and eggs on request
- Rooms which were clean, spacious and came with all of the amenities expected
- Hotel also provided complimentary fruit and snacks in the rooms
- Hotel has a Starbucks inside and a Turkish Spa / gym
- Very convenient links for bus and metro at this hotel (2min walk) as well as 7 minute walk to nearest local restaurants. Quick to taxi via Airport (booked via Booking.com and had a good experience)
- Shower strength good and warm. Easy to use.
- Generously late checkout (12pm) with complimentary gift on leaving",8.0,June 2023,"June 30, 2023",Deluxe Double Room,7,Family,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0.0013325714303520774

A decent location for a decent price,"Primarily service issues: 

* We were short one towel set when we arrived (we'd booked a triple room; one of the friends just used one of the bath robes for her towel the next day). 

* We made a couple of service requests over the course of our stay (once for an iron, once for additional toilet paper); neither of those were fulfilled. 

* When we checked out our airport transfer driver noted that nobody from the lobby had assisted us with our luggage. We're all self-sufficient and so we didn't care, but the driver felt that for a hotel of that standard that was unacceptable. 

The property is beautiful but the service leaves a lot to be desired; it is listed as a 5-star hotel but the service isn't at that level. For anyone to whom that matters that's something to be aware of.","* Plenty of toiletries.

* Free bottled water when we got to our room, and replaced each time we had the room serviced.

* Though we didn't include breakfast with the booking, upon checking in breakfast for each day, for all of us, was added to the booking free of charge. We only ended up making use of that on the first day, but it was still nice. 

* Our city view was prettier than we expected.

* A good amount of space for the fact that it was a triple; it felt less crowded in than some single rooms I've had on my own on my travels.",8.0,September 2023,"October 5, 2023",Deluxe Triple Room,4,Group,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0.0013275952440110924

Stale smoke smell in our room was very off putting - had to keep the window open at all times.  The smell is most likely embedded in the carpets, so they either need a deep clean or replacing.

Book somewhere else,"Not going there again.
They will keep turning your A.C off as it is centrally controlled. Even at 33 degrees C. You have to call them, then they will say they are sending someone, but it magically starts working within minutes. 
Breakfast is monotonous and bland. You cant eat it if staying for more than 3 days. And also no A.C during breakfast serving. The restaurant is not big enough to accommodate all guests, so go early otherwise you might end up sharing table. Ordered omelette on 2 days and they were not up to taste. 
English, most of them dont understand any of it. Would have been helpful if atleast reception knew what the customers are talking about. We gave coffee cups to room service who didnt give it back in the 4 days, even when they serviced the room on 2nd day and us asking for it 3 times.
Location is not near the tourist attractions, restaurants or shops(which was our fault in not researching the location properly before booking). Uber needed at least 80-100 TRY, one bus would get you there, it is 15 TRY pp(not ideal if you have buggy as it can get quite crowded). But people are friendly and do try to make space.
There is black mold in the shower/bath tub. Quite noticeable amount. 
Although not part of the hotel, but the amount of scams you have to look out for ruined our whole experience in the city.","The facilities outside the room are good, swimming pool, rooftop bar, starbucks in the lounge, 3 lifts working non-stop.

"Very friendly staff,  great breakfast, convenient location!","I didn't like that the cooling system/Air conditioning system in the room was turned off  during the period we were there. The front desk staff told us that the hotel management usually turns it off at this time of year (March), until  maybe the end of May.. Such decision might be fine with some guests but certainly not everyone. The room temperature was uncomfortably warm for most of our nights at the hotel. This made it difficult to get a good nights rest after a busy or eventful day. 
I hope the hotel management would consider this aspect, and set up a system that makes the room temperatures more comfortable and enjoyable for EVERY GUEST. 
Since the hotel is in close proximity to the major roads, there was continuous noise (day and night), coming from car traffic. 
The traffic noise wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue if we didn‚Äôt have any need to open the window, as the external noise level does drastically reduce when the window is closed. 
However, we had to open our window many times in the effort to  cool down the room a bit, especially at night when we were trying to get some sleep. 
I would have happily given a 10 rating if not for the uncomfortable room temperature!","Our room and the hotel environment in general was very clean. The breakfast was definitely good value for money. The hotel provided many breakfast options and they all tasted great.

Beer was good, cold, and reasonably priced.

Sure, 5* of 15 years ago, but still 5*.

Only problem, the hotel is in need of a refurbishment, or at least a nice trough deep cleaning. The furniture is dated, the carpets on the hall floors are worn and stained, but everything is fully functional (apart from the AC but they fixed it...)

Next day the situation improved but there were still times when the power went off in the night. Very frustrating. 
AC is another big problem that everyone in my family faced. AC centrally was being switched off from time to time which resulted in rooms being too hot and humid for a comfortable stay or sleep.","Hotel is clean.

Also, our final price was heavily discounted (roughly 50% off) - for that price we were satisfied with this place. If they would charge us full price, I would find it very questionable for what they got to offer.
- The wi-fi is quite bad (we were at 7th floor), even the special one they offer at extra fee. The connection drops all the time. In 2024 you would expect a strong coverage on all floors with good bandwidth and included in the price, especially if it's ""5 stars"" hotel.","- Breakfast was great - very large selection of everything.

Worth a stay for a short period of time if the rooms are lower priced compared to similar hotels.,"- At the end of our stay, the receptionist asked us to rate the hotel on this platform (which wasn‚Äôt a weird request). However, we were approached by another staff member in the bar next to the lobby and he urged us to give ‚Äú10 points‚Äù to the hotel on Booking.com. He was friendly but he didn‚Äôt want to leave until we would do such action. In fact, he even pointed towards my phone to get started. We insisted that we would only rate the hotel at home. A bit later, I went to the toilet and he approached me right after exiting again and gave me a business card of the hotel (see attachment) and once more asked us to rate the hotel ‚Äú10 points‚Äù. As guests, we felt a bit uncomfortable.

- On the way back home, we asked the reception to book us a taxi back to the airport. Several staff members told us it was a fixed price of 650 lira. However, the taxi driver in the end charged us 762 lira. Since we were in a hurry, we didn‚Äôt make a deal out of it on the spot. Nonetheless, we paid less for our ride from the airport to the hotel when we found a taxi on our own that used his meter.

- Some extra little details in the room were minor inconveniences (door slamming, airconditioning having problems‚Ä¶.)

- Overall, worth a stay for a short period of time but do not expect the treatment and facilities that come with 5 star hotels. I wouldn‚Äôt rate this hotel as such one.","- Convenient location to take the metro or tram to go downtown.

An upscale value in a great location,"Housekeeping missed cleaning/making up our room the first day and we had to remind the staff three times. The air conditioning leaked onto the floor on two different days, but the staff engineer was immediately responsive and fixed it. Still, why should it have leaked at all? At the spa, one front desk person was so rude he can only be accurately and truthfully described as an ""a**hole."" He detracted from our overall spa experience. There was a wedding celebration at the hotel one evening that lasted until nearly 11 PM. It featured music so loud our windows vibrated.  We're all for new experiences, but that was a bit uncomfortable. 

Although unrelated to the hotel, I want to add that travelers should beware Istanbul taxi drivers. They don't use meters but negotiate the fare. They will cheat you if they can. Some do not accept credit cards. Based on our experience, they drive recklessly. Had we been more familiar with the city we would have tried the public transportation.

We got told the next day we could have a room with 2 single beds or the same one. 

The cleanliness was not up to standard. There was dust all over the floor which my baby reacted badly to, there was mould im some parts of the bathroom and the toilet paper holder kept breaking off the wall. You can turn on a switch to have your room cleaned but if the cleaners have already been in there once they refuse to go back in.

Great experience for one day stop in Istanbul,nothing,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Akgun Istanbul Hotel, and I must say it was a wonderful experience. This five-star hotel may be located a bit far from tourist attractions, but the proximity of the red line metro station made it very easy for me to access all the main attractions.

The hotel's janitor, reception desk staff, and bellboy were very friendly and made me feel welcome from the moment I arrived. The hotel's interior is stunning, and everything was clean and useful. My room was spacious with a queen size bed and a small sofa. Even though I arrived two hours earlier than check-in time, the hotel provided me with complimentary tea and coffee while I waited. But the waiting time was only 15 minutes, and it wasn't a problem at all.

During my stay, I found that the safe box in my room was locked, and I asked reception for help. The service man was in my room within a couple of minutes and kindly helped me with this problem. While I was out in the city, the hotel surprised me with a complimentary fruit basket, which was lovely.

The breakfast was included in my room price, and it was an extremely rich buffet with a big variety of hot and cold meals. It was one of the most delicious breakfasts I've had at a hotel. The raw honey in the frame for honey with honeycomb was one of the most interesting installations. The hotel's upper level bar offers a breathtaking view of Istanbul, and although the swimming pool was closed for the winter, the lobby had many activities, including a barbershop and cafe.

I plan to bring my family for reunion in a couple of weeks, and I would love to stay in this hotel for all 20 members of my big family for a week. The hotel's spacious rooms and excellent facilities would be perfect for accommodating my family, and I am sure they would enjoy the hotel's friendly service and delicious breakfast.

Overall, the Akgun Istanbul Hotel is an excellent choice for anyone visiting Istanbul.",10.0,March 2023,"March 22, 2023",Deluxe Single Room,1,Solo traveler,9,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0012014874446916852
Excellent hotel in the enchanting city of Istanbul,Great hotel in the beautiful city of Istanbul,"Hotel Akgun is a lovely and fairly large hotel located close to the Fatih area on the European side in the fascinating and beautiful city of Istanbul. Due to the proximity to all the historic sights and sounds, it was very convenient. The valet parking was outstanding with impeccable service. We rented a car from the airport and felt the dedicated parking garage with valet facilities was a superb bonus. The room was good in size, considering European standards. The air-conditioning was initially an issue but was immediately rectified upon requesting the front desk as they changed our room where the ac was functioning properly. The room and the attached bathroom were clean and in perfect condition. The property, though quite old, appears to be very busy and favoured by the tourists. The best part of the hotel was the ever smiling hotel staff all across the property. The buffet breakfast was fantastic with rich spread to satisfy the taste buds. Whoever we asked for something such as bottles of water or anything, the staff were super responsive, and the items were always delivered with a smile. Hotel Akgun is indeed a great hotel in the enchanting city of Istanbul. Due to pre engagement back home, we had to depart two days earlier than schedule, and we were surprised as the hotel front desk offered us refund of two days of hotel charge.

Good,,"I had high hopes for my recent stay at what was advertised as a 5-star hotel, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. Right from the start, I was let down by the cleanliness‚Äîthe bedding had stains, which was quite a turn-off. Even worse, the air conditioning was a disaster; it barely cooled the room and kept making this incessant squeaking noise.

When I tried to get these issues fixed, the response from the staff was disheartening; they seemed completely uninterested in helping. The room itself felt stuck in a bygone era with its outdated furniture. On a brighter note, the breakfast was fairly good, offering a decent selection, and the location was definitely convenient‚Äîclose to public transport and surrounded by some nice restaurants.

But honestly, I expected so much more from a place that claims to be a 5-star hotel.

Good,"First of all, the pictures on the website are quite different from the reality. The free Spa service and Gym were what attracted me to book the hotel, but i got a shock when i couldn't get a Spa with massage even for a day. The girl at the Spa reception was very rude and spoke only Turkish. Also, most of the staff in the hotel don't really understand English that much, so it was difficult communicating or getting real directions. I suggest they put detailed information with services that requires extra fees e.g Spa. The gym in website looks big but it is quite small. If they can arrange a particular place for smoking, it will be nice for non smokers and families with children, because people smoked even around the pool and terrace which was very uncomfortable. For me, it didn't meet my expectations of a 5 star hotel.","The staff were very helpful and welcoming, especially SAMET and RAIF. Always available to help.

Very old hotel. Book a different hotel.,"This is a very old hotel that is stuck in time and has not been modernised. The rooms are very old and need renovating, especially the AC, bathroom and TV. A 5 star hotel should provide luxury in the room, instead it feels more like a budget hotel room. 

AC is a big issue, it is a very old system and does not cool the room at all. Guests should not be sweating in a room that has AC switched on full. 

Cleaners should not be knocking on the doors at 9am to clean the room. This is too early to be knocking on rooms.

Breakfast should provide more options, such as more cakes/pastries. There was limited fruit (apples only) options too.","Hotel lobby and reception give a good first impression but then the closer you look everywhere, including the rooms, you realise that this hotel probably was a great hotel over 30 years ago but has not been renovated or upgraded with time.

Definitely NOT a non-smoking hotel,"- the whole hotel smells of cigarette smoke
- we had to move to another room in the middle of the night as cigarette smoke was coming out of the air-conditioning and air quality in our room was similar to a smoking night club.
- a lot of very inconsiderate guests (leaving their door open the whole night and shouting to other friends in rooms across the hall way, parties in rooms, smoking in the corridors).
- in a non-smoking hotel the fine for smoking in rooms should be higher than the equivalent of 20 Euros. It seemed like the guests just paid the fine and kept smoking.
- after moving to another room at 2am and not having had much sleep, we asked for a late check-out so the kids could recover from the night The receptionist offered a late check out ""if you give us ten stars on booking com"" . Therefore don't believe any good reviews you read about this hotel.

The only good thing about this hotel is the staff,"That's going to be a long list
1. The hotel needs renovation ASAP! the decor of the hotel is from the mid 80' at best
2. No air conditioning in the room - Well, it's not that there is no air conditioning in the room, it's just that it's more like a fan. The air conditioning didn't cool down the room at all. It was warmer in the room than outside. tried to ask the hotel staff to fix it but apparently it wasn't an option. Ended up getting a fan to my room to allow me to ease the heat.
3. Gym - the picture on the website is one thing, and the actual gym is totally different. The gym is a three old treadmills and that is it.
4. location - although there is public transportation near the hotel, it's a bit far from all the main attractions and takes about 20 min each way.

I could go on about the fact that my room was facing three schools and there was contact noise in the mornings and many other things","The only things that were good in this hotel was the staff and the size of the room

"Dated uncomfortable hotel with non-functioning air-conditioning, but with good pool.","Airconditioning not working entire 3 days and despite 3 complaints nothing was done. Unbearable temperatures inside the room approaching 30 deg C. Was told nothing they coud do.
Looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1980s or 1990s.
Our room had a massive water stain on ceiling and down one of the walls from a prior flood or leak above.
Bed was very old and the most uncomfortble we've ever slept on.
Pillows were cheap mis-shapen lumps with polyester foam stuffing inside.
Bed covers (blankets stuffed inside a cover, not duvets) were narrower than the beds!
The sofa bed looked 40 years old and was like lying on a plank.
The bathroom was outdated, with silicone mastic everywhere patching up leaks and gaps around the bath, with mould spots.
Towels given out at pool are the size of hand towels so they reach only halway down the length of the sun loungers.
Despite us spending hundreds of euros in meals and drinks, the staff are way too over eager in presenting you with drinks and food bills, in some cases they gave us the bill and expected to be paid even before we had been given our food and drinks. Ridiculous for a ""5-star"" hotel.
Pool shuts at 6pm.
Location of hotel is near nothing, only a main road. There is a metro about 100m away to leave the area this hotel is in.
Breakfasts were awful; limited cheap processed meats and cheeses with horrendous juices that were simply kids syrups diluted with water. No quality breads or rolls either. 2-3 stars at best.","Excellent sized pool with plenty of sun beds and large sun shades.

No way a 5* hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights to finish off a holiday in the country.
It appears opulent on arrival, however the rooms are a different story, like going in to a 1980's time warp. Air conditioning is non functional (in the heat of Istanbul), changed rooms and still not really any better. Locks on door failed 3 times, carpets were trip hazards, bathrooms had mould and poor repairs, grey towels which were frayed. Housekeeping failed to service our room and then knocked on our door late at night to give us water we hadn't ordered, they also left room door wide open all day after cleaning. Staff only responded to complaints after 48 hours and continual reminders from usand then tried to elicit a good review from me in exchange for a free meal by way of 'apology'. My wife is now in bed with food poisoning from the same meal! This is in no way a 5* hotel and needs complete refurbishment of rooms, a new aircon system and wi fi that actually works. Staff also need proper training, eg manager didnt even want to engage with us about our complaints and we had to continually remind other staff about someone seeing us about the matters we wanted to raise.","Plush public rooms, good pool, excellent breakfast,",3.0,September 2023,"September 20, 2023",Deluxe Double Room,4,Couple,9,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0.0009975872487022557

The rooms were not cleaned thoroughly, Bathroom stained grouting around WC, floors and walls, basin/bath inc shower attachment (broken). Bathroom mirror broken, strange deep hole in wall....
It was obvious my room had been occupied by a smoker (burn marks on carpet and windowsill). Also dried lumps of snot (as a Foster parent, I knew what they were) on the bedside table and side of the bed. Huge deposit of grime under the plastic screen on the bath/shower.
Actually, one could see the difference floor by floor in the hotel, when getting out of the lift at the wrong floor by mistake. 
Our floor had carpets that should have been thrown away, dingy paintwork etc. - so did our rooms.","Breakfast - seemed like a good selection.

Not worth the stars,"A Hotel claiming to be 5 star. When we arrived we noticed wall paper peeling away from the walls, stains on the carpets and lights that did not work as well as plug sockets coming away from the wall.

This hotel says they supply air-conditioning. However, this isn‚Äôt true. we arrived and felt warm so tried to turn on the cooling system within our room only to realise it was blowing out hot air. we reported this to reception and were told it‚Äôs a communal system and they can only have hot or cold which is controlled by the staff (then why are there individual control panels in the room..)

around day 2 we received a text from customer services asking if we were satisfied with the room. I mentioned all of the above but they only responded to the air conditioning query to which they said they‚Äôd send an engineer. when the engineer arrived he said the same, that it‚Äôs a communal system and there‚Äôs nothing he could do. we asked what we should do as we‚Äôre very warm, his suggestion was to open a window.. which, in itself was very annoying because the road outside is constantly noisy at all hours of the day and night. so you have a choice, roast or open the window and be kept awake all night by the sound of traffic.

further that that, the bed was very uncomfortable. you could feel the springs as you lay on it and they dig into your back leaving you with very poor sleep.

we tried ordering room service and were told it‚Äôd be 20 minute. after 40 minutes we called to chase this up and were told the oven had broke so they can‚Äôt make the food. they would not have told us this if we did not call to chase.

we were left extremely disappointed. I don‚Äôt recommend anyone stay at this hotel. the management do not care - after every bad review they leave the exact same response. and I have no doubt they‚Äôll do the same for this one too.

it seems all the money went into the lobby. the rooms feel like they‚Äôve been left behind with 1960s/70s decor.",breakfast was okay,3.0,March 2023,"March 24, 2023",Deluxe Double Room,7,Couple,9,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0.000888071919538107

There was a foul sewage smell coming from the bathroom, especially from the shower. The towels were unclean and old. The location was very bad and far from everything. The breakfast was unappetizing, and the restaurant staff were unfriendly.

Requesting for a refund,"To begin with, the check-in process was chaotic and frustrating. Upon arrival on the first day, we had to wait for 45 minutes to get our room keys. The reception area was crowded with dozens of people, and the staff at the counter were neither welcoming nor efficient. When I finally reached the desk and inquired about the delay, I was told that the staff were already working overtime. While I empathize with their situation, it did not justify the nearly hour-long wait after a long flight.

The room we booked was a suite, but it came with its own set of problems. The internet connection was extremely poor, and even after requesting a WiFi booster, the situation did not improve. Additionally, the air conditioning in the room was temperamental. We had to call maintenance twice during the night, and although they claimed to have fixed it, the room remained uncomfortably hot. This was particularly problematic given the high outside temperatures.

The pool hours were also inconvenient, open from 10 AM to 6 PM. This schedule is unusual as it prevents early morning swims and forces guests to swim under the scorching midday sun. 

I would strongly advise against using the hotel's in-house massage spa. My wife had a particularly distressing experience, returning with bruises and sore joints after a supposed deep tissue massage. The untrained staff left her with four bruises on her hands and back, and a very swollen wrist.

Regarding the food, the quality was average at best. The breakfast spread was decent, but the √† la carte menu for lunch and dinner was very poor. We did not enjoy the taste of the dishes we tried.

Given the numerous inconveniences and the subpar experience, I am requesting a partial refund from the hotel. Akgun Hotel is certainly not a 5-star establishment, and I hope they take this feedback seriously to improve their services for future guests.","I  recently stayed at Akgun Hotel, which is advertised as a 5-star establishment, but unfortunately, it falls far short of this rating. My experience at the hotel was riddled with several issues that significantly impacted my stay.

The only positive aspect of our stay was the exceptional customer support provided by Mr. Samet. He consistently tried to address our concerns and even allowed us a slightly later check-out time and booked an early slot for a massage.

Good,"The staff at the Loby Bar do not deliver a fiscal bill.  They charge without clear prices.  For example, double and regular Turkish coffee are charged once for 60, and the second time for 90 Turkish liras.  The reservation conditions state that the use of the sauna is free.  However, they require you to book an appointment, without any clear notice.  The rooms are clean, but the inventory is quite worn.  The restaurant has sufficient capacity, but the staff is very poorly organized, so used tables remain uncleaned for at least ten minutes.  The laundry service is very unfavorable.  For washing about 4 kg of laundry, they asked us 1,500 Turkish lira - about 80 euros.  Beyond any reasonable price.  The use of the pool is free, but it is impossible due to the wild behavior of the guests, which the staff knowingly tolerates!
