Good,"The design is modern but very boring and dismal. The rooms are small, dark, the corridors are gloomy. There is no wardrobe, only a bracket and a chest of drawers. For 6 days, tea and coffee bags were placed only 1 time (1 bag). The doors to the floors have electronic locks and are hard to open. This increases safety, but all together creates a depressing impression. The street around the hotel is under renovation, making it difficult to approach and drive up, but this is temporary. The price is too high and does not correspond to the size of the rooms, level of comfort and design.",The location is good. There are many pubs and restaurants around. The central square is a 5-minute walk. Friendly staff. Nice lobby with space to work. Modern design. Everything in the rooms is new.,7.0,May 2024,"May 14, 2024",Standard King Room,6,Solo traveler,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.001748190222403809

"Welcoming,  clean, and excellent location",Not much to complain about except I felt the lighting in the room where the mirror is situated could have been brighter.,"Friendly, welcoming and relaxing vibe in reception. Staff  very pleasant and helpful making check-in process a breeze.
Room very clean and towels changed daily. Bottles of water in room were appreciated.
Window that actually opened, unlike other hotels. Effective air con and heating controls in room. TV that included streaming facility.
Quiet area despite being in a city centre and as our room overlooked the private courtyard there was no outside noise at all.
We didn't have breakfast but did enjoy a delicious evening meal and dessert. Again, service was top quality.
Location superb, 2 minute walk to shops and cafes, 5 minutes from George Square and 10 mins to Glasgow Green.   Very accessible to Argyle, Queen Street and Central train stations.

Great hotel,"The address provided is the wrong address. 
The hotel is actually on Brunswick street not candleriggs.
If you or someone in the room around your runs the hot water there is a loud humming noise that fills the room like there is an air bubble in the system somewhere or there's a water pipe not secured to a wall and vibrating.we where in room 354. 
Space between our bed and the table was a little too narrow for a big clumsy guy like me I hit my shin on the bed frame a few times.","Great location in the city centre but not with drunken folk walking past singing shouting n fighting under the window.
Really clean, stylish.
The café/restaurant is set up for people with most allergies and preferences e.g vegan friendly options gluten free options.
The foyer is full of comfy sofas and places to relax and a pool table.
The staff are all friendly and happy to help but theres no uniforms which can make them hard to spot.
Rooms are more spacious than a lot of more expensive hotels we have stayed in.

First time visiting Glasgow? Base yourself here.,"The only strange feature of the studio-style room that I booked, is that the sink is outside of the bathroom rather than in, presumably due to how the space has been divided for efficiency. I can't say whether this is true for all room types. One plus is that the natural light meant the mirror ring outside of the all-black bathroom was fab for applying makeup.","This hip hotel has a similar vibe to Citizen M, but with the added bonus of free table tennis and snooker in the foyer! If you're lucky enough to have booked your stay during one of their many monthly art and social events then you're sure to have a packed out itinerary for your trip. Suffice to say, the amenities on site blew me away, there's a theatre and a shop (supporting charitable causes) and the cafe does great coffee/sweets too. It's a self check-in system but the staff always welcome you with a useful speech about everything you need to know. The room keycards are wooden and they are SO cool, becoming optional keepsakes after you have checked out. The elevators are well lit and love the rainbow interior - loads of unique features in terms of art choice. I stayed in a studio-style room which was en-suite and had ample space for what I needed. It was slightly industrially-styled which is to my personal taste. It has an open wardrobe, plenty of storage, spacious bathroom/shower, desk and very comfortable bed - worth noting that it's a medium hard spring mattress which I appreciate is not to everyone's liking. On my first night I had an issue with the bed as it creaked loudly with any micro movement, however when I relayed this to the staff it was immediately fixed by the maintenance crew! The room is equipped with everything you need from coffee brew bags to shortbread nibbles to hairdryer. Housekeeping come round every day and are very lovely people. On one of the days I was tied into an online meeting, the cleaning staff offered to skip my room and come back in 30 minutes to allow me to complete the call. Linens and towels were changed each day, and refreshments also replenished generously. You will not find a more well-priced contemporary hotel situated this centrally. Merchant City is a brilliant place to be based as there is so much to see and do.",10.0,August 2024,"August 12, 2024",Single Room,3,Solo traveler,9,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0016708854398791192

Great wheelchair accessible place to stay in the city centre!,"Extremely loud creaking bathroom door. There was only 1 chair for 2 people. Despite having a room close to the top we could hear noises from the outside (but only when people were getting quite loud downstairs in front of the hotel, this only happened once or twice during the weekend). We could also hear people talking in the next room.","There is a lift in the building, and the room including bathroom, sink and toilet was fully wheelchairs accessible. In the room and in the bathroom/toilet there were emergency cords. Staff cleaned the room and added coffee/tea/water/biscuits every day. The room had an adjustable air conditioning system and it was very easy to set the preferred temperature.

"Its clean, the bed is SUPER comfy, the rooms can are brilliantly blacked out for sleeping. Despite having a preferece fo","No information in the room to tell us how things worked. So we couldn’t get air con to change temperature, digital dial looks like it is probably fairly simple, but despite  being quite tech savvy we couldn’t get the system to change settings, its like it was locked.

Likewise with the tv, all the music channels were foreign, we thought when it said streaming we thought we might be able to log in to our netflix etc. But it just offered an HDMI socket, it said we could ‘cast’ but we couldn’t work out how to do that either?  So again an instruction laminate would have been useful.

The ‘decorative’ jam jar type ‘lights’ hanging just at ‘smack you in the forehead’ hight in the corner by the window are definitely decorative as it seems they have hit so many people, who might happen to be over  5ft 2” tall in the forehead so many times that the bulbs may have blown. Unless of course the switch in the wall under the not very smart TV is also for decorative purposes?

We consulted the very thick ‘social hub’ bible on the shelf. However we were left frustrated to find this was also ‘decorative’; unless we were moving in for 2 whole weeks just to read about social hub. No instructions there.

We contacted the property prior to our stay to ask a couple of questions, however no one answered.

So we asked at ‘reception’ corner if it was possible we could have 2 additional pillows, because I have an injured leg. Only 1 was delivered.

It was too late by then to ask for early check in, when we asked on our arrival AM it was very obvious no one had read our message as we were told to come back after 3pm. End of.

We asked if it was possible we could have some more milk, because there were only 2 teeny tubs of UHT milk in the room. So assuming that after you have clattered your head off the decorative jam jars that you might like a cup of tea, you must bear in mind that it is strictly ONE cup per person, per day!","Spotlessly clean, modern, quirky, family friendly with ping pong and pool table on ground floor.

Great location with a nice restaurant,"First  I did not know whether it was a n alarm of some kind or what was the noise that kept at times happening, especially late at night it woke up. The reception told it was trouble with pipes and water flowing in them. Later a staff member came to check again at my room and explained reason etc. I now knew it was nothing to worry about , but the noise was at times loud. I was suggested if I want to change rooms, but the noise could be heard around the hotel anyway. This was not a major issue after I knew what it was, but it could have been made clear in check in that there is some issue with pipes and not to worry about noise. 

The room had no fridge (which is more and more common everywhere)

Signs when arriving to restaurant state: wait to be seated, but then staff just looks at you from behind bar counter. The staff was very nice, but would be clearer if someone from staff then clearly comes to the sign or perhaps the sign could say: ""approach bar for dining"" . Not a major issues and staff at restaurant was very nice, food good too, but there's a difference with relaxed atmosphere and guest/customer not knowing whether doing something wrong.","Great location and easy to get to central places and railway stations. Good fish and chips in the restaurant too. Room had kettle so making tea was possible and when you used one tea bag it was right away stocked again the next day.

"Highly recommend (in fact, have already done so!), and will definitely be back for a longer stay","No stairs! I could see the staircase on the ground floor, but the corresponding area on the accommodation floor seemed to be an emergency exit. I'm not a massive fan of lifts, so prefer to use stairs where possible, and also as I was leaving the hotel to go out that evening both lifts seemed to be being held on other floors because they took ages to arrive. If you're in a rush, you just want to run down the stairs. I think there may have been another bank of lifts but there was no signage anywhere on the accommodation floors, so you just had to stick with the ones you'd been initially directed to, or wander around looking strange.

And as always, I think a small fridge in hotel rooms would be a very handy addition. I do like to spend time in hotel rooms that I've paid for, and there's never enough milk provided for coffees, so having a little fridge to keep your own in would save having to ask reception for lots of the little single-use plastic containers of it. I ended up, as usual, nipping to a shop and buying some sachets of latte.","I arrived early at the hotel in order to ask if I could drop my bag off. The extremely helpful lady actually checked me in and gave me a room two hours early! As it was a very hot day and I'd been up for about 8 hours at this point, you can imagine how welcome this was. The room was very comfortable with coffee-making facilities, a large TV (which I managed to cast Amazon Prime from my phone on to), and a large shower with an adjustable head which is quite rare these days. Enough coat hangers for a one or two night stay, and plenty of other storage options. Very nice toiletries, including body lotion, which was a nice touch.

There are so many facilities which you're not going to use as a single person on a one-night stay, but these included a pool table, comfy area for reading books, decent-sized bar/restaurant, laundry, and a gym.

Less than a mile from the main train station, few minutes' walk to the river and shops, and about a 40 minute stroll along the river to the Hydro which was my destination for the evening.

"Ok for short stay, might depend on the room you are allocated.","There were a few things about the room experience that made our stay a bit more uncomfortable than expected especially for the price we paid.

The sink in the bathroom was slow draining, and to get hot water we had to turn the tap on full blast so the sink filled up way too quickly. The towels had been left on a rail right next to the toilet which seems a bit unhygienic, and there was no mirror in the bathroom? The one mirror in the room was nowhere near a plug making using the hairdryer with a mirror impossible. 

Lastly, there was a no inside lock on our room door (maybe because this was an accessible room?) and there was a security light at the door that stayed on all night with no way to cover or turn it off. This meant there was no way to fully black out the room for a good night’s sleep.","Location is perfect for staying in the city centre, the bed was huge and pretty comfortable, with plenty of pillows on the bed.

Additionally, the quality of the coffee provided in the room was outstanding—definitely a highlight of my mornings!

A hotel that gets it right.,"The lighting at the sink was a little low when trying to do make up. Everything smelt very new, which wasn't unpleasant to me but might be for people with sensitive noses. 
But that's it, I can't think of anything else!","I was surprised at how good this place was. It's a huge, modern purpose built place, the kind of place I'd usually hate, however it's very well thought out and put together. Comfy bed, well sound proofed rooms with black out curtains, central but surprisingly quiet location, great shower, good toiletries. Sink was outside the bathroom which is very handy when you're sharing a room and both getting ready at the same time. Little touches like having Clipper teabags instead of bog standard stuff make a difference. The price for the room was very reasonable compared to other hotels in Glasgow when we looked. The downstairs facilities are great particularly if you were travelling in your own, there's pool and table tennis, a gaming console, comfy sofas, a workspace, and a cafe. And they were showing the Euros football games in the theatre.

"Chic, Stylish but NOT Soundproof Rooms","Noise from other rooms, be that from a human or mechanical source. The humm from the room above 334 was not due to building works outside, but was either a water pump or something being used in 443.","This is a very stylish and chic hotel that has only been open for 4-weeks, so like anything knew it takes a little time to bed down. The place is great. Full stop. Even if you are not staying here, it's worth popping in for the food. The Korean Chicken and Chips, delicious.

My only issue was noise from other rooms. I was there a night and started in 654, but the guy in 653 insisted on playing the Eurovision on high volume. I knocked on his door and he said he would turn it down, but he didn't. After 90-minutes, I just thought, ""F*ck it!"" and went and complained to the staff. They were great and swapped me to another room. The second room of the night was 334. Nice, except for the weird noise that came from the room above. It was like a long humm. More like a European phone ringing, but really loud. I wondered if it was a water pump, whatever it was, it was a pain. It did quite down, but thena started again at 1:00am when the couple upstairs had obviously returned from a night out. If it's a water pump, it needs sorting, otherwise there will be further complaints.

The one thing I can say is that the rooms are NOT sound proof.

I wouldn't stay again because of the potential for noise disturbance, but I would return to eat. The food was excellent.",7.0,May 2024,"May 11, 2024",Standard Queen Room,1,Solo traveler,9,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0.0014115850868953595

Okay for a short stay ( executive room only ).,"We decided to book the deluxe room this time and see what the bigger space had to offer. First, the room is much bigger but has the exact same furniture as the smaller rooms so it’s really just a lot of empty space. The beds were awful compared to the executive rooms and we were right by a kitchen that had us listening to the door slamming non stop. Unfortunately we were pretty disappointed, we had to move 2 times as the beds were broken, and ultimately asked to be moved to an executive room as that’s what we had stayed in previously and had no issue. Once we were moved it was a much better experience. That being said, I had paid for late checkout and we were reprimanded by someone with an iPad that we had to be out by 12, they didn’t believe I had booked late checkout until I physically pulled up the receipt I had been sent.

Not at all as good as my first stay.,The staff actually threw my laundry on the dirty bench. I saw a huge fat man melting into it I wasn’t about to wear that stuff. It had been in the dryer for three rounds cause they DO NOT WORK AND THEN I had to start the whole process over and re wash them at 9:30pm. It kept me up till midnight and I was supposed to go out with friends I met! Thennnn I see my booking.com package came w breakfast and I didn’t even know. When I checked in the guy helping me goes oh would u like to add breakfast?so of course I didn’t think my package included it. THEY LOOK UP YOUR RESERVATION TO GET YOUR KEY WHY DIDNT HE TELL ME I HAD IT INCLUDED ALREADY. That really pisses me off. Don’t ask me if I want to pay again for it that’s very misleading so I wasted like $40 and didn’t even know. That really bothers me. It was very misleading being asked if I want it. Why would I think I have it!  It was very hard to get out of the shower this room was built wrong. The king size room was bad. Had no where to open my luggage I couldn’t get to the window and then the shower door barely made it open you’re like in the toilet drying off.,I liked that they had laundry for free.
