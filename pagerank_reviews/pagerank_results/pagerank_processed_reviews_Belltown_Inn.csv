Pleasant,The noise precluded sleep. Even running the AC fan all night did not block the loud people in the next room. The walls were just too thin and the other patrons were just too loud.

"Clean, comfortable and elegant rooms in a good location with a friendly staff","The only issue, at least with our room, was that it was on the back alley.

I got a last-minute mobile discount from booking and for being in downtown Seattle the price was very competitive. The room was nicer than we expected and the location was fine.

Fine for the price - met my needs,"Hotel setup is weird for interior courtyard rooms, which look across a narrow courtyard into other hotel rooms. If you want privacy you have to close the shades and forgo natural light. Not a huge issue but since I was in the room working during the day I noticed this. My particular room was fine with no one in the rooms across the way, or they had their shades drawn, but I would not have wanted to sit and work for hours with the room right across from me occupied with people looking in mine. Unfortunately many of the rooms on the street overlook the dog park that is also a gathering place for local sheltered and unsheltered folks - also not the greatest for spending daylight hours in the room since the hotel doesn't have many floors and you are pretty close to the street. I had one of these first and moved due to the noise of the housekeeping supply room across the hall where the door banged in the frame every few seconds (while closed) due to air movement in the hallway when the courtyard window was open. It's nice to have a sink and microwave, but you have to ask for plates and silverware and there is no sponge or dishsoap provided so you can't clean up your own dishes.","Clean and quiet, fine size, good bed, nice location for my needs.

The Belltown Inn met our needs for comfort and convenience for a night in Seattle.,The room felt cramped. Fair warning to travelers who aren't used to cities: the neighborhood was a combination of gentrification and living on the street. I don't know enough about Seattle to know whether all the downtown neighborhoods are like this.,"The hotel is within walking distance of the Paramount, which enabled us to walk to the show we were in town for. It's also within walking distance of the Pike Place Market, but the parking we paid for allowed in and out, so we drove. The staff was super nice. The room itself was nice enough but a little dated.

Would definitely recommend!,"Offsite parking (which is disclosed): choice of open lot about a half block away or underground garage. When we arrived to check in and we’re parked in front of the hotel, there were numerous homeless people arguing and talking about drugs. Obviously the hotel has no control over this, however, we were concerned about leaving our truck in the street lot as it has a topper on it with some fishing gear in it (we can’t take all this into the room). We chose the underground garage (same price). Access is in an alley and once you find a stall (we had to go down a couple of levels to find one we could get our truck into), there is no access to the stairs or elevator to get out. You have to walk around the driving area to exit.
Would suggest the open lot if you have a larger vehicle or mobility issues. This is just for information for people with a vehicle- the hotel itself is excellent.","Close to Chihuly Glass and Pikes Market. Room and facilities very clean and staff was awesome.

Location !!,"Parking is 33 per night, we managed to get a spot in their very limited space kitty-corner of the hotel. 
The location is not very safe, many homeless people (which makes me sad). I wouldn't go out alone.
Small rooms, ours must have been very low-rated (view on a dirty backstreet and close to the next building) even we paid a lot. 
Check out was at least average.","Very good location, you can almost walk everywhere. Rooms quite small but okay.

We were also able to take the link from SEA/TAC to a stop that was less than a 10 minute walk from the hotel and the cost was only $3/ person.  The room was on the smaller side but very clean and a great place for us to rest our head at night.  There was a lovely little rooftop deck along with complimentary bikes.  We were able to walk to the Space Needle, Pike’s Public Market, and the ferry terminal.

Great staff,"While the location was convenient, it was kind of dead. Especially if you are from another country it might be surprising for you. I'm used to people being out and about all day, lots of businesses that are open early and/or late, etc. It makes me feel safer to see other people about. I wouldn't say this is an unsafe neighborhood, but being used to something very different was a little stressful. It might be a really different experience on the weekend though. We were there two weekday nights. Despite the deserted feeling of the location, I'd still say it's a good place for a one night stay if you want to take the train from King Street Station in the morning. It's either a short bus ride or short and cheap cab ride. The cab was only around $7 and we had big pieces of luggage so we used that.

"Management is incredible. They train the staff well. As a guest, I was well taken care of.

Other than that I enjoyed my stay.,"Overall, I am satisfied with my stay here! I'd stay here again.

Cleanliness 
10/10 Inside the hotel, public bathroom, and my room. Looks, feels, and smells clean! I was impressed by how carefully placed the items in my room were.

Staff
10/10 Incredibly kind and helpful. I had special requests in my booking, and I was immediately given a response. In person, the staff members greeted me and asked me about my stay. They gave useful recommendations based on my interests, and guided me how to get the most out of my stay here. 

Location
8/10 It's a major plus how the hotel is walking distance from a lot of the tourist areas. I will mention that there are a lot of homeless people roaming around nearby, although they seemed harmless. So in the day time I felt safe. 

Appreciate
Free bikes, helmet, lock, and basket! On the less rainy days, I loved traveling with the bike. 
I like how they let me leave my bags after I checked out while I explored the city.
I appreciated the early check-in. I like that I was given the option of being able to choose a balcony room or courtyard.

Great hotel in a great location.,"We took light rail from the airport and walked from the light rail station to the hotel down 3rd Ave. The walk was flat and not too far but the stretch from the station towards the hotel is not the best example of Seattle streets. It did not feel unsafe during the day but there were a number of homeless and ""characters"" along the way. The area closer to the hotel was fine. If you do the walk, go right over to 4th Ave and then down to the hotel.","The location was excellent for us. Walking distance to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. It appears that the whole hotel was renovated not long ago as everything was in great shape. Everything was fresh and clean and the staff were courteous and helpful. We ate dinner the first night right around the corner at Marrakesh which was very good and the waiter was very friendly (we were there early so it was not busy). He suggested La Parisian Bakery for breakfast which was also just a short walk from the hotel and highly recommended. He also suggested we get the the CityPass which we normally would not normally have purchased but it worked out very well and we ended up doing a short harbor cruise, the Space Needle, Chihuly Garden and Glass display as well as a rainy day visit to the aquarium, perhaps a few things we would not have done had we had to pay for them individually.",10.0,June 2023,"June 16, 2023",King Room,3,Couple,8.3,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0006351683831503388
Great place to stay while visiting Seattle,"Be mindful that this is in the downtown area, and although we never felt un-safe, there are a lot of homeless people and apparent drug users in the immediate area.  We had to walk by them, but they never approached, panhandled, or bothered us in anyway, maybe because the local police have a strong presence.  Also, the hotel entrance has a security person after hours.  The morning of our departure, we left very early and walked to the subway/rail system (about ten minutes) to catch train back to the airport (about 30 minutes), and the streets were virtually empty of homeless people, so we can only surmise that there are anti-loitering rules during certain hours.","We spent four nights here.  It was a little pricey, but worth it.  We liked the friendly and helpful 24/7 front desk service.  The location was perfect, and as the hotel claims, you really can ""walk to everything"" - the waterfront, Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, restaurants, etc.  There are lots of little neighborhood eateries, bakeries and a convenience store across the street.  We especially enjoyed a little Italian place a few blocks away.  The room was very small, but modern, well appointed with nice furniture and exceptionally clean.  We asked for a quiet room and it was.  (Fifth floor, facing courtyard.)   We depended on our feet and the bus system to get around and it worked out great.  There is a bus stop directly outside and a subway/rail stop ten minutes away by foot or three stops by bus.  We were even able to catch a direct bus from our hotel way out to the Flight Museum for a dollar each (senior fare).  What a deal!

Comfortable place close to tourist attractions.,"NA - I would like to address the “homeless” negative stuff from other reviews and figured this was the best place for others to see. This is completely prevalent in metropolitan cities and is NOT THE FAULT OF THE HOTEL. We were asked for money/change maybe 3 times. They left us alone, we never felt unsafe or bothered. We were here 6 nights and sure, there were some on 3rd and Bell, but they were not “lined up outside”. There are definitely areas where there are larger groups, but that is typically 3rd and Pike and 3rd and Pine due to those being high traffic tourist areas. 

If this concerns you, you can use 2nd Ave, 1st Ave or even 4th Ave and 5th Ave to Bell and just walk down the 1-2 blocks to the front of the hotel. If seeing people who are in a bad spot and just doing what they can to survive makes you uncomfortable and unsafe, that is unfortunate. But there are plenty of other places to stay for you to be more comfortable and ignore the issues with cities and society as a whole.","tl;dr: comfortable place, walking distance to most things, would 1000% stay again if we visit the city again.

We stayed here for our super belated honeymoon trip, 6 nights total. We came during off season, so the price was super reasonable. 

We had the king suite with kitchenette and it was the perfect amount of room for us (1 large suitcase, 1 med suitcase, and 3 duffle bags/backpacks). The bed was somewhat firm, but not uncomfortable (but that’s what we like), the pillows a little soft for us but also not uncomfortable. 

There is not breakfast provided, but that is stated on here AND their website. Biscuit B*tch is right next door and AMAZING and has good prices. We had breakfast from them 3 times. 

The toilet paper is a little thin, but the staff were able to provide extra rolls, towels, and a dinnerware set for the kitchenette (we didn’t use housekeeping while staying which is why we requested the tp and towels). 

The hotel is close to everything. 10 minute walk to the space needle/mopop/chihuly, about a 5-10 minute walk to pike place market, and about 10 minutes to the west lake center (little shopping mall with a light rail station, highly recommend this stop if you are using the light rail from SEA-TAC to get here).

Good,"- Old hotel, decoration needs a refresh, definitely outdated
- Small room
- The hotel was right on the addicted people street. I walked a fair bit around and one or two blocks away it is wayyyyy less sketchy. Not the greatest when you re a single woman.
- Coffee at reception was frankly bad, that's not a good look for SEATTLE....
- The inner court is sooooo small. You can't open your curtains or you are right in another people's room.
- I could hear the people above me taking their shower and walking around. They were well awake around 3am....

Disappointing,The parking is inconveniently located half a block away from the hotel with very few places to stop at check in. When I opened the door to my room I was hit with a strong smell of mold and smoke-even though it was a non smoking room. When I opened the window to let fresh air in it was so loud outside that we had to shut it to sleep. It is like you can hear everything that happens inside and outside the hotel. If you are unlucky enough to be place above the Biscuit place get ready to be woken up early by them yelling orders nonstop out of the window. I don't even want to start on how dirty and scuffed all the furniture was. The bedding was so gross. I am lucky I brought a blanket with how nasty the cover blanket was. The mattress was so uncomfortable. If you want to pay mid city prices for middle of know where motel quality then stay here. The location is the only positive. We were never asked about our stay or helped either.,The hotel was very centrally located. The shower pressure was excellent. The bathtub was a good size.

Convenient location to City University with plenty of dining options.,"The Belltown location has a lot of street people around. There was a fake parking attendant dressed in ""security"" clothing in the parking lot who tried to swindle me out of $30 for parking. I never carry cash, so I went to the machine to pay and then a person drove up and told me that the man was an imposter. The lot does not have an attendant, so beware. Also, several people were hanging out at the store across the street drinking alcohol and smashing the bottles on the street. It was unpleasant.  The situation is not so bad during daylight hours.

Good location but NO PARKING AT ALL. This must be removed from the hotel description.,"This hotel does NOT offer any parking despite the description in the ad. They will charge you extra money with tax on top to park in a location away from the hotel. Anyone can book this for themselves for cheaper than what the hotel charges. Also, they wanted 30 dollars per night for parking when it is actually free to park outside the hotel overnight.

Dangerous,"Blankets were thin, and uncomfortable. There was no clear indication of what was available to us to make up a ‘kitchenette’, and when I asked what was available the manager said ‘stuff like that’ rather than actually answering my question and offering options. So we were never aware of cooking supplies, or hot plates that could have saved us some money on dining out. If you wanted to smoke, you had to walk down the street, and take your chances with the local crackhead population. I saw some of the most violent things in my life, standing outside this hotel to smoke….. there’s no security, but the manager will chastise you in the lobby in front of everyone, if he thinks you were standing a little too close to the safety of your hotel, to smoke a joint. The rooftop is a lounge space of maybe ten feet, too far from the buildings edge to actually see anything nearby, just a view of construction cranes and the sides of skyscrapers nearby. They wanted 65$ for a ride to the airport, and that was apparently ‘a deal’-spend the 6$ and take the LightRail instead. The elevator takes ten minutes to show up, and if the housekeeping is making their rounds, they’ll force you to wait for the next one, and push their way into the elevator- carts and all. I work at a hotel in my city, and i know that’s not how you operate in hospitality. I don’t think I’ll ever visit Seattle again, but If I’m passing through- I certainly won’t stay here.","The price, and proximity to pikes place, I also enjoyed the tiny balcony and water pressure. ‘Biscuit bitch’ cafe next door, you can order from your room and take it back, instead of eating in the cold.",5.0,February 2023,"February 10, 2023",Petite Queen Room,4,Couple,8.3,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0.0005431627408755432

"NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, EVER AGAIN!!!!","LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.  You take your life in your hands when you are walking to and from this place.  It is in the very heart and confluence of drug addicts, mentally ill, and homeless.  Belltown is located on 3rd and Bell.  We were told NOT to walk to the Belltown on 3rd street.  HUH???  The evening front desk person even kidded us by saying:  “Oh, you made it alive.”  We had a seriously mentally ill man with a knife or weapon swing at us as we approached the Belltown upon returning to our room from a Mariner evening baseball game.   We were lucky in that we mainly walked with the crowds as we were leaving a Mariner game (around 11:00 PM on a Friday evening) and it was heavily attended by people staying in the various hotels in downtown Seattle.  Unfortunately, Belltown is a little further north of the downtown area and we were by ourselves for several blocks.  Snake Plisken “Escape from New York” would have felt at home here.  This section of town looks like a 3rd world country.  Downtown Seattle is a mess!!!  What’s tragic is this isn’t a bad hotel to stay at, unfortunately, it is NOT safe in and around the surrounding area.  I would never expose children to this area of town.  If I could turn back the hands of time, my review would probably have been very favorable pre-covid.  Now this place is a disaster.  Caveat Emptor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Two of the front desk staff were friendly and helpful.  The night staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful and gave us some ice for our room.  When we checked out the front desk girl was not very friendly and when I asked for a receipt she said she couldn’t give me one since I had made the reservation through Booking.com and only they could  give me a receipt.

Very Good,"In the heart of downtown seattle is expected to find some dirty streets and a very large population of homeless people at anytime of the day, even when the hotel was at walking distance of certain attractions it was a little bit uncomfortable to be walking down the street and looking at people in a highly intoxicated state doing crazy things.

One can ruin it. Try not to let it.,"Front desk employee in the morning, male with a beard, wore a mask around those who did and didn't when others around him didn't, literally flipped out and had to walk away from my fiancée and I when nobody fully explained how parking works for those who travel to the ""most pet friendly city"". We liked Seattle for this, but it truly was ruined for us by the hotel employee, and this is a first for me to write this, but I can't ignore it. Just as a decency, those who stay at hotels generally aren't accommodated to the area in which they are staying and it's always appreciated feeling like there's a safe place to be in a relatively unfamiliar area. Upon arrival from the east side of Washington, there's a parking lot we plan to use, but getting a pass for the lot isn't the most clear, so we go inside to see what they may offer or at least advice. A kind young woman said we could park on the street because Sundays are free and can move it by 8am the next morning and get a parking pass through republic parking for $30 and we can go in and out of whatever lot we choose. Excellent. Next morning, about 7am, I ask the front desk employee that I mentioned and he advised that there weren't any available. I was confused, nobody said that there was a limit, especially since we just took our dog out, checked our vehicle and to see if there were any spots left in the lot (there were). My fiancée just started to chime in and I said they didn't have any passes available, so she asked him what he meant by that. That when emotions flared up from him quite unexpectedly, as if we were prepared for him to literally tell her to ""okay lady, you need to calm down, don't need to freak out"" as he start to shake his hands in the air and walk away to the back. Mind you, we still don't know what it means that they don't have any left, we didn't know they could run out.","Room was nice and perfect size, comfortable bed too.

"The hotel was fine.  However, the location itself has drug addicts outside openly doing drugs.","The neighborhood is questionable at best.  There was a drug deal directly outside the main front door in the late afternoon.   My rule of thumb in areas that are questionable is to walk at a brisk pace and don't engage.  It's similar to being in Paris and someone is trying to get you to sign a petition and then they demand money.  You just don't engage.  Multiple homeless tried to engage anyway with a few rants with one being aggressive about fighting.  Something I normally wouldn't do is take a 1 mile Uber ride as it's generally pointless.  I did that after leaving the Space Needle after 9:30pm.  On two occasions I saw people injecting themselves with drugs.  I've been to every large city in the United States and have experienced quite a lot.  What I saw in Belltown was worse than anything observed down in L.A. on Hollywood Blvd.

"Given the above, the thing that made my stay at this hotel stand out was interacting with Dean.","I understand that there are many rooms for the house keeping people to take care of so this one is not a biggie.

We left the room in the morning to do some morning and early afternoon sight seeing and we came back to nap/rest before going to dinner. The house keeping people made it to our room when we were taking naps. This was around 4 pm every day. Again, I understand that they can't do EVERY room before noon.

The other thing was the lack of space out front to unload/load. When we arrived we had to drive around for about half an hour because there was a car loading/unloading and there were not any available parking on the streets. I had to call the desk and Dean helped direct us to the customer parking. It would have been fine with 2 - 3 parking spaces to unload in front of the hotel.",Dean is a rockstar!

Please AVOID this hotel,"Please AVOID this hotel. Lax cybersecurity led to me losing data and money to hackers, with no help from hotel in response. Choose one of the many other hotels in Seattle who actually care about their guests. 

I was the subject of their weak cybersecurity standards when their systems got hacked and I received a message from the same phone number the hotel had previously messaged me on regarding my reservation asking for my room cost upfront. I quickly realised after paying and receiving a further request for money that it was a scam and notified the hotel immediately. Two hours later the hotel emailed all other guests telling them to ignore the hoax SMS and any emails from them.

As I had lost the cost of my stay at the hotel, I emailed senior management asking for my stay to be waived or some equivalent compensation. Despite emailing twice, I never received a reply and what made it worse is that they told the hotel’s reception staff to ignore all my complaints regarding the hack and my pleas for compensation, demonstrating they had read my emails and decided to ignore them. Genuinely one of the worse episodes of customer service I have received. Regardless of my requests for compensation, the least they could have done is acknowledge my emails with a response but they didn’t even bother to do that. 

So please don’t stay at this hotel. Given their weak cybersecurity standards, there’s a high chance your personal details will get hacked and senior management at the hotel will not care if you lose out in this situation. There are plenty of other options in Seattle - please choose one of them.",,1.0,July 2024,"July 13, 2024",Queen Room,1,Couple,8.3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.00021274464146079855
