Great stay in the centre of downtown Houston.,"There were smudges of make up left on the walls of the bathroom and the towels had a lot of mascara smudges from previous guests. I think they needed another bleaching, or two. Oddly, the fitted sheet for the bed didn't cover the last 1/2 foot of the bed so my feet could feel the mattress protector. This wasn't a big deal... just odd.","The location is excellent for nearby restaurants and the metro connections. The restaurant (Bistro 7?) on the ground floor was very good though they were a bit short staffed whilst I was there. They were excellent though despite being rushed off their feet!

"Overall, my stay at the hotel exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend","there were a couple of downsides to my stay.

The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of downtown, making it easy to explore local attractions and restaurants.   

The hotel offers a fantastic range of amenities.  The complimentary beverages  in the lobby were a nice touch, making it easy to unwind after a day of exploring.

Disappointing,"I stayed at this hotel for over a week and the first night was very disappointing. I had already paid for my reservation, I arrived at night to check in. The next day, I went out to do my tour of Houston, when I came back, the attendants said that my reservation was for 1 day...
After I showed the booking and payment receipts, I discovered that they had checked in on someone else's behalf! In other words, I don't even know if I stayed in the room I had reserved... I thought it was absurd. Very young and unprepared attendants and the hotel manager or a senior manager did not get in touch to apologize for such a basic error.

"Great location, average amenities.","Small room - I’ve stayed in smaller rooms in other hotels before that had modern amenities at the same room rate at perfect locations.

Microwave - coming back from the concert at 10PM, I had wanted to eat some of our leftovers from a local restaurant that we stored in the mini-fridge at the room. I asked the staff at the check-in counter if they had a microwave available to be brought up to the room or just at the lounge where the complimentary coffee is. Apparently… they did not have one and the restaurant at the lounge was already closed. At least have one or two in the lounge for people like me… lol. I understand that you can use deliver apps but that’s hands down a $50 dollar meal you are purchasing due to fees and tips added.

TV - screen mirroring / google cast did not work with the TV, followed all the instructions and it worked with just showing my phone’s home page but as I opened Netflix / Hulu or any streaming apps, it would not project onto the TV. Suggest to add a Smart TV instead, with apps already installed. 

Bed - not as comfortable and was only provided with two pillows, I believe we could ask more pillows but it should be a minimum to have 4 if the bed is not as comfortable.","Location was perfect for the concert we were attending at Toyota Center.

I’m going to the front desk three times at this point because he attempted to get the elevator to work for me to go back up and get the rest of my stuff - that last time I was frustrated because it hadn’t worked and this was four times, and she rolled her eyes at me again, and said “ he push the button you just need to be patient and wait!” which wasn’t the case at all because the light was flashing red each time which meant the cards they were using weren’t active.

Rooms need a make over but the lobby is lovely and its a great location,While the hotel cannot help the conditions on the street in downtown Houston in regards to homelessness we did not feel comfortable walking to our destination even though it was less than a mile from the hotel and one of the main reasons we chose to stay at this location. What appears to have been the original entrance once is now closed off forcing people to enter where the valet stand is and the check in counter is a tiny stand wedged into an alcove in the wall along a skinny hallway instead of out in the openness of the main lobby. This was extremely frustrating having to move to allow other people in and out with bags and carts while waiting to be helped since none of the self check in kiosks were available. Upon checkin a woman was training a new hire and did not even look up to acknowledge us but kept speaking to him about other guests and their payment and room situations - very unprofessional in front of other guests. The rooms are outdated and not in line with the style of the main lobby. The carpet and walls were dirty.,"I appreciate the valet service considering the conditions on the street near the hotel and not knowing where our vehicle may be safe in a self paid lot.

We had the air as low as it would go and the fan on high and still could not get comfortable!! I requested a higher level Room but instead we were placed on the 4th floor and our view was the dumpster!!

Excellent stay other than 1 night in the restaurant. Perfect downtown location.,"Only one thing. The attached restaurant, Table 7 had excellent food for all meals. Grayson who was there every other day was excellent, however; there were 2 servers on other days that were not. My wife and I arrived before several other people and were not served drinks, menus and food before all the others. In fact we were the last to leave where at least 12 others had arrived after we did. We were there 1.5 hours and only had a cocktail, wine and our dinner.","Excellent location, easy check in and out.

Decent and well located property,There's no complimentary breakfast.,"The Location of this hotel was perfect as you can walk to the Theater District, Green District, museums Old Market Square, Little Tranquility Park, Discovery Green Park, Buffalo Bayou, Downtown Aquarium and most of the sites in downtown. We rarely had to use taxi. It is also very close to the light rail system, 

Check-in and check-out is self and quite easy. The reception staff is always there to help you in case you need any assistance.

The room was very spacious, clean, and comfortable and had everything we needed. The room was provided with a TV, mini refrigerator, telephone, tea/coffee maker, iron box and free Wi-Fi.  Bathroom had free toiletries.  

The lobby of this hotel is very huge and looks modern. A business center with newspapers is available. There are plenty of seats with ports for connecting your laptops and mobile phones. The best part of this hotel is that you can enjoy unlimited complimentary snacks and refreshments in the lounge whenever you want. You can fill your water bottles also here.
Club Quarters Hotel in downtown Houston offers a fitness center. The self-service laundry is free of charge, whereas, most of the hotels charge for this service. Unlike in other places, there are plenty of washing machines and dryers, which avoids waiting time. I heard there is no free parking, but, there is parking available nearby, which is charged. There is also valet parking available.

Great location for concerts and sporting events,"Nothing really. System was down for their app you're supposed to be able to use for everything, but that wasn't a problem at all. I was fine with the ""old school"" check-in with a person and get a key card :) I would note that I ordered food from the restaurant through Yelp/GrubHub that said my order was received, but it actually wasn't, so when I went to pick it up they hadn't even started yet, despite what Yelp said. So just be sure to go in person or check-in with them to be sure they got your order.","Spent 1 night in Houston for a concert at 713 Music Hall and this hotel was within walking distance (0.7mi, 15-20m) at a better value than surrounding hotels. Room was clean and comfortable. The room is quite small, at least the single bed rooms, which was fine and even welcomed for me. There was the bed, TV, desk, closet, and bathroom. Definitely snug, but perfectly fine for one or two people for a night or two. Friendly staff on check-in, nice public spot downstairs to meet others in your party, attached restaurant serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner which is very convenient. Parking is in a lot across the street, $25 for 24h with in and out privileges if you talk to the staff and pay in advance. Was a really convenient option, close by, access to the car if you need it. There is also valet. Or you can pick any other lot in the area if you want, but this one was convenient, safe, secure, easy parking. There is free street parking after 6p but seemed like a pain. A lot seems to be the only option if staying in a hotel downtown. Hotel was secure, you need key access for the doors and elevators. Wasn't sure what to expect regarding the safety of the neighborhood, but the theater district is quite nice and walking around at 6p and 11p was perfectly fine (I was there on a Monday so it was quiet, well lit, and not many people out other than some concert goers).

Good Location But That's It,"The room wasn't as small as other reviews mentioned  (I was imagining prison cell size) but it wasn't big. It lacked the basics most hotels in this price range offer like a microwave and fridge. They also don't offer breakfast or daily housekeeping due to 'COVID safety' but it felt like more of an excuse to cheap out at this point. Especially since the guest closet they have on each floor to safety restock room entities yourself was always empty minus coffee creamer. 

Also on the first night coming back, they mopped the floor and didn't have signs up. My friend slipped and fell hard on the floor and was in pain for the rest of the 4 days of the trip (which involved a lot of walking). We told the desk right after it happened and all they did was have someone dry up the floor and gave her a bag of ice...

Good,"The toilet tank would never refill witout me manually adjusting the rubber stopper that did not seal after ever flush. That was very frustrating. 

The most frustrating scenario was the Valet service. When I turned over my car to the valet, he told me within an hour I would receive a text message with my claim check and it would be used to retrieve the car when I was ready. I check the vehicale in at 12:45 a.m. Two hours later I had not received a text from the Valet. I texted Customer Servicej and their response was ""Okay, if you'd like to come to the valet desk and verify that all the information is correct, we can let hinm know."" This was around 2:30 a.m. and I'm in bed. I ask if the valet desk can call my room to verify the information was taken correctly and they responded, ""Unfortunatelyt they do not have a phone."" I had to get out of bed and fully dress at 2:30 in the morning and I was NOT HAPPYl! It gets worst. 
The following day 11/28, preparing to check-out and head to the airport, I requested my car from my cell phone link provided, went downstairs and the valet started looking for the keys and could not find them even though the claim check with the tag number system they used was in the link. It took half an hour to get my car and the valet was frantic as he just had no idea where my keys were. He ask if I remember who checked my car in (do we really have to remember such facts?) It just so happens I snapped a pic of the guy checking the car in and I show him.  I was livid as the entire process

Underwhelmed but not completely disappointed.,I was on the 9th floor.  The room i was given was extremely small and I was disappointed.  I complained about the smell and the noise since they were doing construction above my room.  & i was provided with a new room with no issue or up charge.   The room was much of a difference with a better view and more space for me and my partner.  I didn’t have a housekeeper come by AT ALL. Even though they have us use this platform to text and ask for service.  I was so not pleased to come back to no fresh towels or the room tided.

I was planning on having a great time with my newly fiancé on my first trip to Texas for my birthday weekend. Not to say I didnt have a great time still but the hotel was the most awful experience. First off i can pictures really deceive the actual look of the room. I was not expecting everything to be so old in the rooms , also my room was way smaller than potrayed online. When we first walked in the room it had a very odd smell was not pleasant to us . We were already throwed off by that then as we walked in the bathroom we see little pieces of hair in the sink which is completely unsanitary.
At this point i was disgusted. Even sleeping in the bed at night the covers had the smell on so it was extremely hard for me to sleep i felt so sick. Not to mention waking up i was feeling a itch that began to spread. I will never be staying here again and can honestly give it a 0 star if i could. On a positive end staff was extremely nice but the room and quality was horrible. And i honestly feel like it was a inconvenience to my first time ever being in Texas and i would honestly like a refund for my stay.",The staff was nice,2.0,May 2024,"June 27, 2024",Small Queen Room,1,Couple,7.9,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0.0005714893995971461

Not to be trusted,"I will relate my story in full, so any potential customers know what to expect. I had booked my stay for five nights and fully paid in advance. Two days before arrival, my flight was cancelled last-minute and I immediately let the hotel know through the Booking.com app indicating the new arrival date. Noticing that they had not replied after 24 hours, I sent another message asking for confirmation they had received the first text. No reply. When I arrived in Houston the receptionist said that they considered it 'no show', but I had the full booking documentation, including the messages they had ignored. So I was given the room I had booked and at the same time told that an amount of $150 would be additionally pre-authorised to cover for potential damages and refunded upon check-out. Ok, fine. One day into my stay I see that the pre-authorised amount had gone up to a total of $346.89, with no explanation. I immediately asked at the reception and was given an opaque answer along the lines that more needed to be pre-authorised, and there was nothing to worry about since I would be refunded at the end of the stay, within two to three working days (a receptionist called Diana). I trusted them. Back in Europe I received an invoice that made little sense charging me twice for 'no show' and multiple taxes (basically they charged no show although I had timely communicated the late check in). They are obviously not planning to refund anything. Please do not trust these people with your credit card details, and go somewhere else. I have currently asked Booking.com to solve the issue and I am waiting for them to process the request.",,2.0,March 2024,"April 1, 2024",Superior Queen Room,5,Solo traveler,7.9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.000524515900533247
Disappointing,"Our bed was dirty, clearly the sheets weren’t changed. There was dirt and hair in the sheets. We asked them to come up to change them, waited almost an hour then I decided to check the hallway. A big bag of sheets was just sitting there. So we made our own bed. The next day we asked for someone to come clean the room and they said they couldn’t because of Covid. But I assume that you clean the rooms after each guest? So why wouldn’t someone be able to clean our bed and change the sheets? They said they would but when we got back the room hadn’t been touched.  It was gross. And I believe there is a leak on the floor in the bathroom, there was always water on the floor. When we checked out the lady asked how things were back home, she assumed we were from New Orleans because there were a lot of people from NO that weekend. But no, we are not from NO and I assume she asked that because we are black…",,4.0,September 2021,"September 11, 2021",One-Room Suite with Kitchenette,3,Couple,7.9,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.000524515900533247

A coffee machine that does not work in one of the rooms, the lock of a bedroom door does not work either.  We took a king size room which had two mattresses.  a shame!  This hotel looks like a student hostel.  I did not feel safe in this hotel.  I was ashamed to have booked this hotel for my family.  The photos do not at all reflect reality but not at all. In the bathrooms the ventilation does not work.  I must have felt the humidity in the room all night. the rooms were very small, we had no place to put our suitcase. Furniture are old and broken.

"Not the best, but good for a 1 or 2 night stay if you don’t want to spend a lot.","VERY thin walls. Was woken up at around 3:30am by an argument between a male and female in the room next to us (I understand this isn’t the hotel’s fault). Later that morning, I was woken up by them again, but they were having a normal conversation this time. The morning after, which was the morning we checked out, we were woken up by the housekeeper cleaning that same room next to us. 
The banging and noise was excessive. We could hear her walking through the room, cleaning the toilet, putting items away or cleaning drawers.. whatever it was. The amount of times this one room’s door was slammed was incredible. I’m not exaggerating when I say it was probably a dozen times. Twice, something was slammed or banged so hard that it shook the adjoining wall, which is where the bed is set up. It was extremely frustrating. 
The restroom and shower could be much cleaner.  There was hair stuck on the restroom wall, along with some makeup from previous visitors. The shower looked like it needed a good scrub on the walls, floor, and shower head. The water pressure was great but only half of the shower head had water coming out of it. The holes on the other half were clogged.
The charging port installed on the table did not work and neither did the phone. This was annoying when I woke up the first morning and grabbed my Apple Watch expecting it to be fully charged, but it was dead. 
The bed and pillows were comfortable. We only had 2 pillows on our bed. I thought this was weird because usually there are 4. I’m sure if I would’ve requested an extra pillow or two (I like to sleep with my legs propped on a pillow) the hotel would have sent some up, but we never bothered with it.

He tried to get in my room by (helping me with my cart) when i unloaded the cart and opened the door, there he was... Just outside the door. Tried to get in again
 I chewed him out. Then he followed us to the elevator again. I told him to go ahead. Then he got stuck in the elevator. Not having a key, not knowing there's a button that opens the door. He screamed at me to open in. I opened it and told him to walk away. He did. I can be scary when necessary. Me and my son got in and made sure the dude stayed out, and we went down. 

I told staff and they got rid of him.

Avoid at all costs,"Avoid this hotel. Stayed for one night on a short visit to Houston. Whilst the hotel itself was ok our problems began once we had checked out. Firstly, despite paying via booking.com in advance for our stay I was charged again after check-out and only reimbursed after repeatedly chasing for the money over the phone. Secondly, one of our party left a MacBook in one of the rooms and. Despite being able to locate the device on apple's ""find my device"" and contacting the hotel only a few hours after check out staff at the hotel were unable and completely unwilling to help with any effort to retrieve it. After two days of back and forth over the phone (we couldn't return to the hotel as we'd travelled to New Orleans), the device seemingly vanished from the hotel only to reappear briefly in Dallas before being switched off - doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out what has happened.

lovely establishment with good hospitality,I ordered dinner to go in the evening and the night shift bartender added a $27 gratuity without asking me or letting me decide how much to tip on a TO-GO order.  He didn’t hand me a receipt either until I asked for one so I may tip him until I noticed he already tipped himself. Not very nice to tip yourself on the bill without mentioning it especially when It was a pickup order.,"Lovely aesthetic and fashionable decor. The front desk manager Max was magnificent and exceptional. His hospitality was superb, he was able to create friendship with my mother and I , rather than just keeping it strictly business which I loved!

Utter disappointment!,"Unsafe, smelly and filthy",There was absolutely nothing to like about this hotel. Our room smelt like a sewage tank the whole time. The hallways smelt stale and moldy. The toilet system in the whole hotel should be replaced. Water was constantly flowing in the toilet. The environment is very unsafe. If you complain they give you a generic breakfast coupon. What a waste of money. It’s a travesty!!! I’m sure the rating they have isn’t organic because honestly this hotel is trash. The place is unsafe. Homeless people sleeping in front of it and you keep having confrontations with them every time you step out.

I showed her the price I paid with breakfast and the cost without breakfast but she was totally dismissive. She informed me that it doesn't matter anyway because breakfast is served from 8 and that's usually late for people. The actual ****! Never again! 

My frustration has not been resolved as booking.com is also not taking any responsibility. It's on their website and they are refusing to refund me the additional cost the hotel have charged me for the breakfast inclusion. After various discussions with their appalling customer service, I've just reported them to my credit card company. 

Unbelievable! Don't book from booking.com, their customer service is equally appalling. They don't take any responsibility  for any of this.
