1. Reception staff were fantastic, friendly, and accommodating
2. Restaurant staff were somehow good, but it takes them ages to serve clients, especially room service despite the fact it is paid for by the clients.
3. The Housekeeping team is the worst of all the services I have seen since my voyage all over the world starting from 1996 to date as United Nations staff.
4. Management's decision to only wash client towels only when they are extremely dirty is the worst hotel decision I have ever all over African, European and Asian hotels.

Hotel with Greta location but very poorly maintained,"The rooms and the bathroom were in a really poor condition. The room definitely requires a serious renovation.
