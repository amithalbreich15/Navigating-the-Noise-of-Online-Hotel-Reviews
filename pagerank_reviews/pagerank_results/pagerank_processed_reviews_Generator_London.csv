"great location, easy and good value for money","cleaning wasn’t really up to normal expectations, they either forgot to do the full room in the morning as it wasn’t not totally clean. there weren’t towels either, maybe that’s normal but we were surprised as we stayed in the double w private bathroom 
long line for the lockers, so we ended up taking the bags to the station to avoid the wait","location, double private room with bathroom was spacious and modern and staff were great: both the receptionist and the guy from Colombia helping us were very nice and fast!",7.0,November 2021,"November 25, 2021",Superior King Room,1,Couple,6.9,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.00044405703388756336
"Small dorm, awful bathrooms","I got put on level 6 which seamed like an extra level they just squeezed in. The lift didn't even go to 6, stopped at 5 and then you have to walk the last level. No sign for level 6, honestly looked like a storage space. Room was hot despite it being 18° outside. All that was provided was a dangerous fan that had no cover on it (open blades spinning) 
Bathroom shower heads were really now and covered in scum. I had to go down to level 5 for a bathroom because there was no bathroom on 6. I paid extra to be in a dorm with less people but I should have just stuck with a larger dorm because they have more space and I would not have been shoved in the attic. In my dorm there was a tap. Which I usually like because it makes it easy to wash hands or brush teeth without bringing all your stuff to the bathroom, however; the tap in my room did not work. Only 3 towel/coat hooks in a 6 bed dorm. The showers have nowhere inside the cubicles to hang clothes or place any other items whilst showering.
The door into my room was also broken and the only way to close the door was to slam it, making it a pain in the middle of the night when people are trying to sleep","The location is good and the check in process is super easy. They have a water filter tap in bar area.
The underbed storage lockers were good also and weren't loud or clunky like I've seen at other hostels. Wifi works well in room but not in the bar area, it slows down heaps.
Cleaning staff were friendly and I saw them often on the lower levels although I never saw one on level 5 (my closest bathroom) and that one was pretty dirty",5.0,July 2023,"July 29, 2023",1 Bed in a 6-Bed Mixed Shared Dorm,1,Solo traveler,6.9,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.00044405703388756336
"For a 1 night stay it’s ok, better heating needed.","£6 towel rental is a bit steep! 

I was in a basement dorm room, it was freezing cold, heating is on timer but the heater was slow to make a difference to the temperature of the room. thank goodness for the thick duvet. 

My dorm was right next to the smoking area so there was constant noise outside and banging doors.

The walls seemed paper thin to the corridor, everything could be heard.","Great location , nice social ground floor and bar area.

Pleasant,"I've stayed in Generator before in Copenhagen and loved it. Unfortunately in London, it all felt a bit grubby and in need of refurbishment. My room (13) was down in the basement, which was obviously quite dark, and smelled a bit damp. It must be situated near a nightclub, as the sound was pumping through the walls at night. I paid extra for a late check out to have a bit more of a chilled Sunday morning, but was  a bit pointless. One set of cleaners came in to do the sheets and were surprised to see me, and another Spanish guy came in, as I was stood in my underwear,to clean. Unfortunately my Spanish wasn't good enough to explain that I had booked a late checkout, so I was awkwardly trying to get ready, as he cleaned around me. I also left the room to use the bathroom, and was then locked out of my room, as it seems the key wasn't updated for the late checkout. I had to go up to reception to get it updated. I was glad I had brought decent pyjamas, and wasn't in my undies at that point, as that could have been quite embarrassing.","Beds were comfortable, staff were friendly, location was great.

Great lively place to stay in a good location.,The lockers are large but as they were under the beds the guy on the bottom bunk gets woken up when somebody needs stuff from their locker. Some other guests did not follow the hotel/hostel golden rule about being quiet in corridors so sometimes it got a bit noisy. The shower room on the floor I stayed on was quite small and claustrophobic but when it was closed for cleaning I went to another on the basement floor and it was much more spacious and more comfortable to use.,"The location is great, near to the Underground, shops, cafes and the British Museum. Fun atmosphere in the common areas with a bar, food, games, decent music, lots of seats, interesting art etc. It was very busy when I stayed with a mix of people (backpackers, school groups, families, professionals etc) but the staff managed to keep the place very clean.

"Brilliant for exploring London, would stay again if I visited London","Only complaints were that the showers when I had them didn’t get hot, I think that was more due to the time of day rather than that they were never hot. Had to ask for towels, which were free in a private room, but kind of annoying they weren’t provided.","Whole place was super clean, everyone was really friendly, beds were really comfy and bedding provided was good and clean. Lockers even in private rooms, just remember to bring a padlock, they do sell them but they’re not that cheap. Location was great, very close walking distance to Russel Square and Kings Cross St Pancras so just a few minutes tube into the centre of London, there’s a few nice cafes just around the corner too, we had a great breakfast at a plce just a minute away. Stayed on the fifth floor and was always quiet at night, the whole building is through a little alley so is back from the Main Street which is really nice and keeps it quiet too.

There was good storage options in the room and in extra areas for luggage. The location was quite easy to find, it’s not far from st pancreas/kings cross. Although it had its own bar, the room was down stairs and not noisy really. The water got hot quickly. Overall it’s a nice place and good price. I made a late booking and was accepted.

A basic yet comfortable stay.,"The showers were a long walk away from the dorm in which I was staying and they were often closed for cleaning during peak times. 
The showers themselves are basic and didn’t have shelves so it’s hard to manage your toiletries within them. 
There was only one small toilet apart from the shower rooms which 2 dorms were sharing. 
I also found it a little expensive for a large dorm room with no private bathroom but I guess it was also peak time.","The hostel is in a very good location and has a great common/bar area.

Tolerable for a night or two but there are better hostels out there,"I stayed here for two nights in two different bookings (at the beginning and end of my trip), and both nights I was placed in a room in the basement whose only windows faced the smoking area. The room stank of cigarette smoke and there were drunk smokers outside the window shouting until past 3am, waking me up at all hours. They don't warn you about this when you check in. Thankfully I'm not super sensitive to cigarette smoke but anyone else who is should be warned. (I stayed in the 8-bed female dorm room both times).

The locker situation is not ideal. The only in-room storage provided are these tiny, under-bed drawers that are too shallow to fit any suitcase. Unless you are comfortable just leaving your suitcase in the room (as many of my roommates did) and locking anything valuable in the under-bed drawers, you're going to have to rent one of the lockers outside for a fee. 

Finally, my bed wasn't very clean at all when I arrived, and I saw several strands of hair and nail clippings around my mattress.","The staff were nice and helpful, despite clearly being understaffed. The location is also fantastic, close to St. Pancras and the tube and in a lovely neighbourhood, in walking distance to British Museum. The fan in my room kept it from being too stuffy.

This was my first stay at a hostel and I usually stay at hotels so maybe I was expecting more than I should have? I didn’t want to use shared showers. 
Anyway the staff were lovely! The hostel on a whole well kept, nothing fancy but nothing to dislike, perfect to take my teenage children to.

Ideal location and great stay!,"One area I would like to be improved slightly would be in the shared showers, maybe a small shelf on the wall to allow you to put your shampoos etc when showering. I struggled to manoeuvre myself sometimes getting my stuff. Knocked it around a bit which was annoying.

The room was great as well, great storage space for any luggage. Only one small problem was not having a pillow case but the receptionist was more than happy to get me one.

"Smelly, loud but well located","The rooms stank, they smelt of mould so strongly. We were first allocated to a room on floor 2, the base from downstairs reverberated making it impossible to rest, the music stays in until 2am.

The sound on the corridor runs through the night, with parties going on in rooms until 4am the first night, and very loud conversations and door knocking at 5am the second night.
The shower took about 5 minutes (timed) to warm up each time - a complete waste of water. And the shower only reinforced the smell of mould. Everything needed a wash after leaving because it was so potent.

In the mixed dorm I had my things in one of the storage boxes (not under the bed) and someone checked in after me decided that instead of using their storage box that they would just pile everything of theirs on top of mine instead so I had reduced access to my things (this person slept through the day and was gone at night so we never spoke and hardly ever saw them). This was super annoying as each person is assigned a box that correlates to the bed number (theirs was underneath the bed).","I was fortunate enough to have experienced both the Private Rooms and a couple of different dorms rooms during my stay here. (I had originally planned to only stay 2 nights as I had accommodation booked elsewhere however the other place was not for me so I came back and booked whatever I could at late notice). 
The place is cleaned throughout the day my multiple staff members and the desk staff were always there to help when needed. 
The location between 2 underground stations (Kings Cross and Russell Square, made for easy transport links around the city), it was also in a location where if like me you enjoy walking then everywhere was walkable (I was clocking 30,000 steps a day). 
The private rooms were a great respite after a busy day and the bed was super comfortable. One private room I had was on the 5th floor was a lot quieter than the other one I had on the 2nd floor but this was mainly due to people being loud late at night in the hallway. 
The dorm rooms I experienced were both on the basement level (both a female only dorm and a mixed dorm) this was ok for the price point. I loved the added mirrors and bench top in the female dorm room to be able to get ready.

Nice stay at Generator London,"I stayed in a 10-bed female dorm, and it was very little space for suitcases. What was a bit annoying is that I had to sleep in the bed that was like 1 meter from the sink. Privacy curtains for this bed would have been great as most girls got ready at this sink. The trash cans in the toilets could not be opened. The shower was a bit weird as you have to really turn it up in order to get hot water.","The staff were very friendly, breakfast was amzing & the rooms were very light. The beds were comfy & you don't need an adapter because the beds have usb ports. In the room I stayed in, there was a ventilator, which was great as it was hot in London.

"Clean, comfortable, welcoming.","I know it’s not in the ethos of the hostel/hotel, but tea and coffee making facilities in the room would have been nice, especially the private rooms. Or even coffee / hot drink vending machines on each floor would be great also. 
Maybe a shower cap dispenser or something in the shower rooms, as I didn’t really want to get my hair wet with being so unprepared.","All of our trains were cancelled due to the closure of the train lines because of the tragedy. So we had no choice but to stay in London for the night, we feared the worst having to pick a hostel style hotel, but we secured a private room with shared bathroom, we reasoned with ourselves that we’d been using public toilets all day, how different could it be. 
We were so pleasantly surprised, it was such a welcoming, clean, safe and enjoyable place. We couldn’t quite believe the price, especially for central London, only a short drive to King’s Cross station and other central travel. The beds and room were clean, welcoming, comfortable. We had a good sleep. 
The staff were absolutely outstanding, so friendly and very helpful, us both with no knowledge and in our 30’s, we needed to ask a lot of questions, but they were so kind, so helpful and patient. They make the stay the staff don’t they. 
The facilities were great, obviously not expecting to stay the night we had no provisionals with us, but we used the laundry facility to clean the clothes we were wearing, bought body wash from the shop, etc. just what we needed. We even indulged in the late checkout which is such a fabulous thing, £15 all told for the private room, for a 1pm checkout. It gave us time to make a plan and ground ourselves after the tiredness of the day before. 
Overall it was a perfect solution, were an easily pleased couple and our first hostel / hotel experience was a very good one. You’ve made a lasting impression.

Very Good,"The showers were not acceptable. I was on the ground floor, so not sure about showers on other floors. The showers were separate for males & females. You open the door, and it's basically just 2 showers, a sink, and 1 toilet cubicle for all the dorms. If someone opened the door while you were at the sink, you had to move into the corner for the door to open. It was tiny! The shower cubicles are far too small and have curtains on them, which constantly stuck to your body as you tried to shower. Shower heads are the big ones stuck to the ceiling so impossible if you wanted a quick shower without getting your hair wet and when you switch it off it just keep dripping while you're trying to dry. There is nowhere else you can dry off and get dressed as there is no room! If you try to get dressed in toilet cubicle there is nowhere to hang anything so your having to put your clothes on the floor and rush to get dressed as usually someone would come in to use the toilet. Cant get dressed in your room as there are males there! Floors extremely slippery from shower water too. 
And if you come in just to use the bathroom, there's nothing to dry your hands with. 
Also, being the only female in a room with 7 males was bad planning. I was too tired to care, but I know a lot of females would find this to be very uncomfortable.

Good,"I stayed in their Amsterdam branch and liked it, but this London branch didn't meet my expectations because:

- Room was VERY small, I stayed in a 4 bed mixed dorm. 
- Beds didn't have curtains like Amsterdam branch.
- My room was very far, I had to get into 3 long hallways to get there. A bit random but the hallways had a bit of a creepy feel as if it was a psychiatric hospital before...
- The room had a dirty small sink and a dirty mirror between the beds and the window, odd. I'd rather use the bathroom's sink...
- My bed was not very clean, I could see a lot of dust in the sides of my bed.
- I noticed they didn't give pillowcases unless you ask for it at the front desk.
- No outlets in bathrooms.
- Pillow was very flat and uncomfy.
- Their entrance has about 12-steps of stair. So if u bring a big luggage like me, be prepared to get some new muscles!
- There isn't much nightlife around the hostel.","- Location is superb for the price. 
- Bed has outlets as well as two USB charging stations.

Pleasant but could use some air-con to combat global warming,"There was no air-conditioning or proper ventilation within the rooms. The windows were bolted in and you can only open them up to a certain degree and it barely allows any airflow. 

It was an oven because buildings in London are meant to keep heat in, and during the heatwave, temperatures soared to 35-37 degrees.

They provided fans but they are not exactly powerful enough to combat the heatwave, granted that it was not expected or taken into account but this is something to take note of when traveling during the summer period. 

The toilets were shared but they are in good condition.","The location for this place was quite accessible and very central. Near the Russel Square Station tube and you can pretty much walk to King's Cross and Euston Station to travel around.

Cleanliness was expected of a hostel, nothing too stellar.

Pleasant,"The room was quite noisy. There was noise from the hall and inside the room. I did not sleep a lot for two nights. Just outside our room there was the smoking area. A smell of smoke was also in the room, although the windows were closed. The showers were basic and there was no comfortable place to change. For me two nights would be really the max to stay here. The hostel is cheap which means anything extra you should pay for but is available at the hostel. I forgot and international charger for example. I think it is quite strange that you have to pay to store your luggage on your last day.","The location of the hostel was great! I had reserved a woman only room and the girls were respectful.

Waking nightmare,"Everything else. First of, the smell in the hallways was really bad and they could benefit from a good air circulation system and air conditioning. Our room smelled at least a bit less worse than the hallway, but was still very hot.
The bed was so close to the ceiling, you just would hit your head no matter what. Some soft padding on the ceiling and a warning would be greatly appreciated. The bed was uncomfortable and lumpy. We missed pillow cases to make up the bed, went to the reception and got 2, but 1 of them was still dirty. 
I didn't even dare to take a shower with the look of those facilities. Also, only 2 toilets for the whole floor is not enough. 
A map of the floor and where you can find the nearest toilet/shower would also be great. 
The music from the common area's was so loud, we couldn't sleep. Also, all the other doors on the floor opening and closing made so much noise you could wake the dead. There was also the sound of the sewers so close to my head when I lay in bed, I was afraid it would all come down on me. Think things couldn't get any worse? We were woken by the fire alarm! Luckily, it was nothing serious and was turned off after some minutes, but there was no mention of everything being okay or something. Also, no one seemed to have taking this alarm seriously, given the state of other occupants, which is going to be a problem if they do have a real emergency. 
Really, this was way too much money for a really bad experience. I would definitely advice people to stay away from this place if you can afford something else.",Check in and out was easy. Location from the train station was great. Room was large enough for two people to stay in for a short amount of time.

Not great,"- We were woken up at 6 AM in the morning by an old but really big metallic emergency bell located within the chamber and close to my head. It started to ring and then stop intermitently every 2 minutes. No information was provided to anyone by the hostel speakers and people ran into caos. Decided to go downstairs just to find that one room was actually on fire and the first floor was full of smoke, so everyone got nervous. All the people had to stay at the central stairs, within the building, waiting for like 30 minutes. At the end, one of the staff just shout to everyone that fire was controlled and we were told to go back to sleep. We were never evacuated or reached the outside.

Great location however this hostel is quite pricey and could do with an upgrade of some facilities,"The room itself was actually quite small for four people and it was a bit difficult to fit everything in (most people couldn't fit their suitcases in the lockers below the bed as they are too small- thus my room was littered with suitcases). Because there was randomly a sink in the room I kept waking up to find that my suitcase or belongings were covered in water or toothpaste from other guests (and nowhere else to put my things). It was also extremely expensive to stay at this hostel over a weekend! Do your research to make sure there isn't anything else out there for you. 

The showers were also quite hot but had that horrible musty smell to them. Could do with an upgrade.

Good,"The showers are terrible. Many were out of order. When you try to have a shower water goes everywhere, soaking the floor and the adjacent showers. There's no room to get changed, dry off or hang up your stuff. The experience of having a shower is really uncomfortable.

The bar area and adjacent room are full of shuffleboards that take up space. Hardly anyone uses them. It means that part of the bar area is always out of use, and the room where breakfast is served is really cramped. The hostel should stop its obsession with these huge shuffleboards and get rid of some of them to allow for more comfortable seating.

Sometimes the bar music is really loud, which means there's nowhere to just chill out, do some work or enjoy a quiet coffee.

"Good stay, the location is great, but i had an unpleasant experience.","1) None of the staffs bothered to help me out when i reached out to them. When i checked out, that evening i came to collect my luggages, I really needed a charger as my phone battery was almost zero. they told me i had to purchase the connector plug for 8 pounds which i clearly didnt want to do as it was my last day. But common guys, i was checked out and was asking them for at least a few minutes to charge.... they saw me struggling with it and yet nobody really cared. 
One lady rudely told me that she cant help. And because of this i had to reach the airport with my phone switched off and had to face a lot of issues. Please be kind to the travelers as they come here from different countries and not all know about the changes in the systems or carry the appropriate things at that time. ( i didnt know the connector plug for the sockets. )Had a very sad ending at this hostel when i checked out due to this incident. 

2) They charge extra to keep our luggage after check out. The check out time is 10am. But my flight was at 9:00pm and i had to leave my luggage at the locker for which i had to pay 6 pounds for 6 hours. 

3) The washroom showers in 5th floor where i stayed was not operational and i had to go to the fourth floor for showers. The shower cubicles are vvvvveeerrrryyyyy small. Like you cant even hang ur towel n clothes. 

4) The toilets in fourth floor was veeery dirty. all of them were either clogged or had some unpleasant sights left behind by the previous user. The fifth floor mens washroom had only two toilets and it was dirty too. Felt really uncomfortable.
but a couple of times it was cleaned though . 

5) The rooms are extremely small. I stayed in a 4 bed room and theres place only for one person to stand in the middle and if he opens his luggage , it occupies all the space.","The bed was comfortable.  The location is great. Made some good friends.

Pleasant,"Well I am very angry because I booked 8 people mixed room, but I get 10 people mixed room. 
I tried to speak with 3 different people in the reception but they said that I am wrong. 
Well,  dear, I can count till 10 and if you do not believe customer try to go with him to his room and check it. 
I also rent a towel and after that when staff cleaned room they took it, so I went to get another one, but  you asked to pay for towel once again. I did not pay for towel, but it is quite annoying...
Another dissadvantage is that near some of beds are not sockets that is inconvienient.
 There is light instaled above head but it is not working.
In the room there is no mirror.

"Great location, okay for a few days maximum","I ended up leaving early because the bathrooms were gross, the showers are tiny and it's not very comfortable.

- zero ventilation in the ground floor dorms. on a summer day it's not ideal
- no hot water in shower
- you have to pay to store your bags after you check out which is not a tonne of money but you will be charged extra if you leave your bags in beyond the time you paid for. I paid £10 for 6ish hours.","- helpful staff, very friendly

good atmosphere was happy with price and overall,"rooms were very small and although the atmosphere was great in comparison to other generators the facilities were lacking here, the room I was in was so tight my suitcase could barely get in the door around the beds into the main part of the room which isn’t ideal especially when arriving late and trying not to disturb other guests, and really only one person at a time in my 6 bed dorm were able to open bags and re arrange or get stuff out of suitcases on floor and get stuff from the lockers under bed.
i had had a long day of travel delays and had to wait around half an hour at 1am to check in as there was so many people at front desk trying to get last minute accommodations, which I understand given the weekend I was here however it would be more efficient if one out of four staff could atleast serve people with bookings especially that late at night it’s frustrating having to wait for people with no original bookings as takes so long, to top it off my key didn’t work 2 times so I had to leave my suitcase in the hall and lug my duffle bag with valuables back up and down everytime, and then my phone was almost flat and they only have usb chargers on the bed- better than nothing but most modern iPhones no longer have usb and every other generator I’ve stayed at had a proper power outlet on the bed so that was extremely frustrating I would have too go down and sit in cafe every morning for half an hour to an hour and charge phone before I could go out for the day, it didn’t appear there was any wall chargers near my bed either but I don’t feel comfortable leaving my phone charging anywhere other than in the bed anyways.
bathrooms were ok but definitely felt a bit grungy could do with good deep clean and upgrades, the showers on level 5 wouldn’t drain so you would stand in ankle deep water getting in and out, I’m pretty short and my head was close to roof and shower head so probably not ideal for tall people as well.","good location close by to kings cross station which runs later than the other line at Russell square so just something to keep in mind if out late, Russell square line will take you straight to Heathrow so really liked that, I would just walk the 30-40mins into the main part of London along the river. 
seems to be a safe enough area and quite quiet. 
great atmosphere, I’ve stayed at a few generator hostels now and probably helped I was here on a busy weekend but was cool to see the bar alive and a good social atmosphere as bars at other ones I’ve stayed at were closed and it was always very quiet around, was pumping and was on level 6 and never heard a thing once I got in the lift.

Generator hostel just wants to generate more profit,"Honestly, this hostel really fell short for me. Check out is 10am to get you to pay £5 extra for a late check out. Renting a towel is £4.

The room I was in did not have heating lol. It was just overall an experience that left a really bad taste in my mouth.

Then in the morning I went for a shower and couldn't get back into the room as the keycard wouldn't work - it was after 10am so I guess the system automatically disabled our cards, even though once again I had paid for a late check-out. I was stood there not wearing very much with all my belongings locked in the room, I was about to go down 5 floors in not much more than my underwear to reception when I managed to wake one of my roommates who opened the door.

A high-end working automated coffee machine like the one in Barcelona I think would really help the staff manage the coffees in the morning. What else?

The front desk was out of a lot of the amenities that were listed on the wall to buy. The slippers especially would’ve been welcomed. I got excited that I could get some of them they didn’t have any

All the properties have loud doors I think it’s because they’re fire doors when they lock. Maybe some rubber pads to dump in the noise …

Four person rooms are very small. With four men, it heats up very quickly. The front desk was happy to give me one of the combo fans and heaters, but maybe something built-in to the window  … all I can think of. 

I’m sure these are future projects.

 The only other downside for me was there was no place where I could boil a kettle for my lemsip  or use a microwave !

Lift was also broken and, according to someone in my room, it had been malfunctioning for a while, rendering the hostel inaccessible.

Unclear instructions about quiet hour and light rules led to antisocial behaviour from another guest.
I had a lady come into my room at 1:50am on my second night to make a bed, though she did not sleep in the room herself. She turned on the bright main light just above the top bunks, causing everyone to wake up from their deep sleep and I was exhausted and irritable at work the next day because of it. Someone else came in later and did the right thing, which was to turn on the individual light at the bed to see what they were doing without disturbing anyone else. I don't know for sure if the other woman was housekeeping because staff denied it when I told them the next day (but why would someone unlock the day, make a bed and leave?), regardless of this, I will not be staying here again because it's not the kind of hostel you stay in if you want rest.","Great location for those staying on holiday and wanting to stay in a safer part of Camden.

worst hostel I’ve been to yet- if you’re in london there are so many other better options for similar pricing than this,"This hostel was pretty terrible from start the finish. The staff weren’t super friendly (which is fine, maybe they’d had a long day) but the beds we were allocated in our shared dorm (6-bed) were dirty and clearly used. upon telling staff of this, they didn’t seem concerned at all and just told us to move beds. This led to confusion later on when we had taken someone else’s ‘allocated’ bed and there weren’t enough clean beds, a problem which could have been fixed to start with. There were also blood stains on the new sheets. The room had a terrible odour- almost insufferable even with the windows open, so clearly there wasn’t any ventilation- it was bad to the point we almost changed hostels. The showers were dirty, stained and didn’t drain properly, and there wasn’t any space/hooks in the cubicle to hang clothing or place toiletries on. so you pretty much just had to go into the shower with a towel only. there are 5 levels at this hostel, and the day we were staying the lift was broken, so we had to carry heavy luggage up many flights of stairs- again the staff didn’t notify us of this or apologise for the inconvenience. Compared to other hostels of similar pricing, this one just isn’t worth it for a cheap stay.

location is ok as its central but I wont be coming back thats for sure.,"Staff didnt tell me anything about how to connect to WIFI. I should have asked them. I thought they would assist in connecting but wasnt so. People come and go so its hard to know who stays in the hostel.  The travellers act like junkies with not a single word said when you meet someone in the hallway. Good manners cost nothing to say even a 'hello'. Must be living sad miserable lives these people. This doesnt reflect the behaviour of staff who are friendly.  The noise at the bar can go on upto 11pm so for those wanting a quiet peaceful time, this place isnt ideal.  Lockers were expensive to rent out, location wasnt easy to find as its not according to the number of property along Travistock Place. Also getting a taxi, they dont stop outside the hostel as its the bike path thats blocking the path for taxis to arrive so you have to walk to find a main road or behind the hostel so the taxi can stop and pick you up. This caused a lot of inconvenience that I had 3 taxis cancelled. The price of the stay in mixed dorm for 4 people doesnt reflect the room size as the room is very narrow, small and you cant open the windows fully. so the room gets stuffy. Not ideal for the price you are charged. Not worth it. I wont be coming back, thats for sure.","The facilities of the hostel were ok, except that its hard to find in middle of the night after you arrive. I couldnt find the place as the number of the property does not fall in line with Tavistock Place. Its about 10 mins walk from Russell Square station. I had to ask a couple of people only to find that the hostel was located not on the main road but near a scaffolding place. The road to the place isnt easy as its made up of small stones along the pathway so much that the wheels of my suitcase got damaged. Getting inside the hostel is through a staircase which is not ideal if you have more than 1 bag to carry and you are a solo traveller. The staff were friendly and hospitable. The lockers are 10Pounds for 24 hours and I felt this is expensive. It should have been about 7Pounds for a day. I was left on my own to figure out how the lockers work and then helped others later once I understood how it works. At first the locker charged my card but didnt give me a locker number so I had to go back to reception and wait until everyone was attended and then the staff came to help me. There are self serving machines on every floor with snacks and drink. The bar is open for food. The bar lady was nice as he filled my water bottle without me having to pay for. The coffee was nice at the bar. The room is very small. I stayed in a mixed dorm of 4 people. There was no space to keep any suitcase and its narrow enough to just walk through and get into your bed. Thankfully I rented the locker on ground floor. It was warm in the room and the windows cannot be open fully. There are nearby shops, cafes and take away food so this is fine as they are open until 10pm. Also the park is nearby. Its just ok to sleep and nothing more.

Every time someone entered my room, i would be rudely awakened as the door went directly into my bunk and made a huge bang. I know the facility is looking to make profit, but if the room is set up like this, they should just make it a 2 bed room. Also, the facility needs to get maintenance in to fix their washing and drying machine, i had to pay for two rounds of the dryer as my clothes were still wet, the receptionist was happy to help and give us a free round of the dryer for the their time, but she admitted she knew the dryer we used had been having issues with not drying clothes; however Generator had not put up any signage to disclose this information.","The bar area of this hostel is quite lively and allows you the opportunity to interact with other solo travellers very well.

The cleaning staff has completely taken over floor 0, so whilst staying there, they were always hanging out there, and having their cleaning supplies all over the place.

The USB charging points at the bed are great, when they work, which was not the case.

OK but could have been a lot better,"The breakfast is really poor, the hot plates were on but the food was cold so clearly no one bothered to check and this was a paid breakfast so even more disappointing. The plates were not really clean and even the croissants were cold. The rooms are tiny and they should really not put 6 people in a 4 bed dorm. The bathrooms are cleanish and not really clean and the cleaner is going through the hoops to clean juggling between people and cleaning when clearly they should be cleaning every hour and closing the doors to not let people in. The whole experience is diminished by the lack of staff in the café and the lady getting overwhelmed by early drinkers before the club opens. The club itself was poorly advertised and dead but that is ok as it was new year's eve.  The other downside is the lift did not work and I did not see an engineer fixing it so clearly there is no regard for customers.  The smoking area has no proper place to bud the cigarettes and also there are stairs leading down to the smoking area which is dicey given that people are drunk and slip on those iron steps.

"Really disappointing as room wasn't ready, despite having an early check-in confirmed.","Our room wasn't ready despite getting confirmation for an early check-in for a hen party. 

I arrived at 12.15pm with two other people in our party as I had sorted an early check-in. The woman behind the desk was apologetic but explained that the confirmation I had received from Generator London via Booking.com was sent in error (by someone who did not know the system) and that early check-ins are not available. She also emphasised that it was a Saturday and particularly busy today. This was incredibly frustrating as we had lots of bags and requested an early check-in so that we could decorate the dorm room for a Hen do, before a local drinks booking we had at 3pm. I explained that this was why we had requested (and had confirmed) and early check-in, which stated we could have the room between 12-1pm. This was really disappointing as we had no time to get ready or decorate the room, before our other friends (including the bride) got there. It was all a big rush and there was nothing that could be done for us except to wait somewhere until our room was ready (with all our things and decorations). The woman on the desk did try and speed up the cleaning of the room for us, however, we were still rushed and only had 45 mins (for 6 girls) to meet and get ready. 

To make it worse, while we were waiting for the room, I went to use the ladies toilets in the lobby but they were closed for cleaning and the cleaner did not know where other ones were. I went back to the desk and was advised where there were more (downstairs and round a corner). 

When we came back that night (around 11pm), we were sure to be quiet as the signs around the building outside said, however did not sleep well due to outside party noise inside and outside (within the hostel).

It was too hot to sleep. Added disturbance at 4:00am when new guests arrived to also find they had no bedding, which caused a kerfuffle. Then when I finally got back to sleep, the fire alarm briefly went off again, apparently for no reason.

Very disappointing!,"First of all, I had a problem with the payment. Second, the staff was very unfriendly and not helpful at all (with the payment for instance, we just had to figure it out ourselves). Also, at the end they didn't ask if we had a nice stay or if everything was alright. Which I don't think is very welcoming. 

Then, the rooms. The vibe was a bit prison like. The sheets were alright, but the beds were very shaky, I don't recommend the mattresses (covered in plastic, which is not a nice feeling), except from the fact that the windows were very tiny and they couldn't open all the way (which I understand) they only could open for I think was 5 centimeters (more or less). So there was not much air in the room and therefore we couldn't let much air in. There was a ventilator which didn't really work. Also, it kind of fell apart when we tried to turn it on (and there was a lot of dust on it), next to the mirror there was hanging a booger (that was disgusting). 

Actually, the list can go on and on and on so I won't make it too long anymore. But I definitely do not recommend this hostel.

Great hostel with problematic entry street,"I wouldn't advise another wheelchair user to stay here. Not because of the hostel itself of the staff, because they were nothing if not accommodating, but because of something they sadly can't help: the side street leading to the hostel. On the photos it looks straight but it's actually a pretty steep slope down, made of very uneven cobblestone. Getting down it is uncomfortable but doable, but going back up took all the help of my mum because my muscles wouldn't have been able to do it. If you don't have either electrical support or people with you, find another place.","Very nice hostel on a good location, it's reasonably clean for a place with this many guests and the staff is exceptional! I'm a wheelchair user and encountered no problems in the hostel. The facilities are more than decent, they have a ramped accessible entrance and a good sized designated bathroom that needs a permission to be put on your keycard by the front desk so not everyone can just use it.",7.0,August 2023,"August 31, 2023",Twin - Shared Bathrooms,3,Family,6.9,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0.0003437443449714115

The most unclean/ unhygienic hostel with best location I have stayed in London,"- Booked Twin room with shared Toilet/ shower, but I was surprised that Toilet/shower was extremely far away  from the room, a good 3 minutes walk down the hallway, 

- They had only 4 shower cubes and 4 toilet seats for approx 20 room in the floor, since each room have bunker beds there are approx 3-4 people, so approx 30-40 people have to share only 4 shower cubes and 4 toilets waking down the hallway in the towel wrapped on your waist. 

- The showers are extremely unclean with water overflowing and unflushed /unclean disgusting toilets seats with poo floating. I have seen in YouTube some European prisons have much cleaner toilets than this hostel.

- receptions staff ain’t that friendly, yet that’s not an major issue.

- The twin room is extremely small with a bunker bed (single size) but No table or chair so had to eat my food  seated on the floor. Nevertheless, the bed was fairly comfortable.

- The windows are not double glazed cos despite the windows was closed and I was in 3rd floor, I could hear loud street noises in my room.",superb location,1.0,January 2022,"January 30, 2022",Twin - Shared Bathrooms,1,Solo traveler,6.9,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0.00034347108449786067
Try a different place.,"Rooms were not as shown. Pictures led me to believe that I would have a bunk or small pod that was enclosed on several sides and relatively isolated or closed off from other sleepers in the room. Instead, I was packed into a small, airless basement room with twelve regular bunk beds. The other guests were inconsiderate, and music from the common area above was so loud that it was impossible to sleep. Staff basically shrugged at the predicament. Any ""extras""--bedding, towels, secure space to store items--were an extra charge. And no outside food allowed. Might be a great place for some people, but I didn't find it to be worthwhile, even compared to other hostels. I ended up booking another place for my final few days and checked out early (no refunds, of course).","Convenient location close to amenities in St. Pancras and Bloomsbury.

"Great location and price, but let down by rude staff, restrictive rules, and a noisy atmosphere.","Firstly, the staff's attitude was a letdown, coming across as quite rude and unwelcoming. The no-food rule in rooms, along with no drinking water or kettle, felt too restrictive. The bathroom being far away was another inconvenience. Most notably, the noise at night in the shared rooms was more disruptive than what I've experienced in other London hostels, making it hard to get a good night's rest.","The hostel's best feature is its central London location. It's in the heart of the city.

Horrible facilities/cleanliness and a clique atmosphere. Only ever consider this for a short stay,"Entered my room to see my bed with crumpled up dirty sheets and empty drink bottles laying on it. When I informed staff, they removed the old sheets and placed clean sheets on the bed but didn't make the bed or even take the rubbish off.
The bathroom facilities are horrid, the toilet doors are vandalised, most of the locks on the toilets/shower cubicles are broken off, some cubicles don't have working lights above them and on my first morning I walked into the bathroom to have a shower only to be standing in a flooded room with water above my ankles.
The only common area is the bar, which is not necessarily a bad thing although they close most of it off when they host private functions there, which is often. Over my 4 night stay they had a private Hen's party on one night, and a private dinner/event for a group of kids aged around 8-9. Extremely odd considering it's got the appearance of a dive bar but without the cheap drinks.
No air-conditioning or fans in the room, only a window that opened slightly so the room was always stuffy. I would wake up covered in sweat every night.","The price is on the cheap side for a London hostel but that definitely does not make this hostel good value for money.

Paid too much for nothing,I was actually ok with the facility although the bathroom is a bit far from many of the rooms and fine with the location as well. What I didn't like was I was being charged 50% more for my 2nd night which was not on weekend. I was told that it was based on supply and demand so I thought the hostel would be full.

Too expensive for what it is.,"The breakfast is terrible, especially considering it's £9. You have to pay to have towels as well as storage room. It was the first time in my life I had to pay to have storage room. And it wasnt a storage room, you pay for a locker. I had to rent 2 to fit all my stuff, so 12  pounds. Overall, everything, including the stay, is way too expensive for what it is. The room I stayed in didn't have a window, which was the worst part. The wall next  to my bed was also stained and seemed dirty.

However, the staff quickly found another room for me with a working radiator. Despite the warmth, the room lacked a desk, but again the staff quickly arranged a chair and a desk for me.

They ask me to use the toilet. the only toilet in the floor was out of order. Than i had to keep my luggage at the locker box room with 7 pound. The single room was so tiny and basic like a prison cell. The corridors are dark. The rooms are fitted ith central heater but after repeted request they did not turn the heater on in 8/9 degree celcius. on the second day I forcefully asked the manager to provide a portable room heater. Then he complied. I stayed for 4 days. my room was not cleaned. on the last evening I saw a cleaning lady inthe reception are. i askd her to clean my room. but the reception guy told me the she can not go to my room at 4th floor. so I asked to send some one. After 30 minutes I came down and asked the reception to send the women inthe reception level to send to my room it will take 5 minutes, just to clean my toilet. But a bearded man came a rudely told me that she can not go. I then reacted and told him you can behave like this. this is my right to get my room cleaned. I will never go there and request no guest to go there unless you are compelled to. The whole premises just painted with some colurs but it is dirty all over the place. 200 pound a day for this dirty place and the room is totally unacceptable.

Disappointing,We had to make our own beds. That was weird. I've never had to do that. Checked in and all of the beds just had a pile of sheets/blankets that we had to make.

They BLAST music throughout the whole first floor so there's no where to really hangout. It's a full on party or go to your room kind of vibe.

Do not book this hostel if you want to sleep for even 5minutes,"Because of the location and for budget reasons, I spontaneously booked this hostel. Unfortunately, I couldn't sleep for a minute. On the first night, my room was on the 5th floor and there was a party in the corridors all night. The doors cannot be closed quietly and every time you open/close them loudly, the light from the corridor falls directly onto the bed. On the second night I was put up in the basement. Here there was continuous loud shouting from drunks in the smoking area of the 24/7 bar, which was right next to the room window. You can also hear and feel the underground every few minutes. The staff did nothing when asked. In addition, there were some snorers in the room, but it was not the hostel's fault. The rooms and bathrooms were mostly clean. It was still an absolute horror. And for that I booked 85 euros per night in a 10-bed dormitory because of the short notice. On top of that, there were extra fees for luggage storage and there is no kitchen, so even allergy sufferers would be forced to buy food there (not possible in my case).

On the subject of bathrooms, the only one on my floor was closed needing maintenance. I had to either wander to the next floor up or to the floor below

Clearly not a hostel,"Clearly the worst hostel I went to so far. I know that London is not especially known for the hostels, but still a bad experience.

First the hostel is clearly more a hotel than a ""youth hostel"". Full of families, and mostly people in their 40, 50. And these people we clearly not backpackers.
So it was quite impossible to meet other travelers in the hostel.

Secondly many people seem to live in the hostel, there was semone in my room whose locker was full of food. Also there was a Deliveroo bag on a shelf. Someone even took control of the only sink in the room, making it really hard for the other to access it.
So clearly not what a hostel should look like.

Third, there is no kitchen, regarding the prices of the food at the bar and the price of the room, it is clearly not acceptable.

Fourth, the place is clearly not comfortable. Only found 4 showers in my whole floor. And god, these were the worse shower I saw in a hostel... No space to hang your clothes, just enough for you towel (don't even think about your toiletry bag...) not even a place to put your soap on... And the shower itself is like 30 cm away from the hook where you put you towel, which end soaked. So few space that a guy finaly managed to leave the shower full naked and put his clothes on outside of the shower. Even the sink got no space to put you toiletry bag. And of course the place look dirty and it smells like sewers.

Fifth, half of the toilets lockers or door were broken and toilet paper in just one of them during my 3 days stay... Cleaning woman will get mad at you if you are in the toilet while they are cleaning.

Sixth, 8£ for a 24h locker, seriously ? Most of the hostel I went to it was free of charge and when I had to pay it was never more than 3€. And I wont speak about paid earplugs...","The staff is cool and kind. I was welcomed by Prince from the night staff and he was especially kind and helpful.

"Disappointed, shame to this chain of hostels","Well it started yesterday I arrived late night and I wanted something to eat, the vending machine didn’t have that much and the restaurant was closed at 1am and I totally get that, but people travel hours and when they get there expect at least sandwiches or fruit or something, on the vending machine there was just chips. I went to get take out food and when I reached the bar area, there wasn’t one table clean and at the counter in reception were 5 people standing doing nothing. Proactivity “0”! 

When I woke up on the next day I went to take a shower when I enter the cabine no working water. Try the other 3, no water! One of them even didn’t have faucet for the shower. I was on the 4th floor and I had to check the other floors bathrooms to see if they had water. I found a guy on the hallway and he was the one telling me to go to the second floor because there was water. Starting my shower, no water pressure. 

Well I have to say something, I came from a trip from a “Third world country” population says and I paid 1/5 of what I paid for a night here and the service was 100 times better than this. I decided to pay more because I already stayed on Generator’s in Berlin and Stockholm and the experience was great and I come to London for my 4th time and it was the worst experience that I had on a hostel. 

With this I don’t say that I will never comeback again to this chain of hostels, i puts a stain on the name of this brand.",What I liked about the property was the rooms and the bed was comfy and they had place to charge the phone with a little shelf.

Good,"I asked if I could eat my sandwich inside. This was approx 10:30 pm after id been to see a band in Hyde Park. The staff told me no outside food was allowed inside…. So I said I’d eat on the steps outside which they ageed to. I sat myself down only to be told by I’m guessing a security guard that I couldn’t eat there despite me telling him the reception staff ok’d it. He told me to go sit on a bottom step in a dark area…. Honestly, a sandwich which I wish I’d just taken up to my room without asking. Sounds petty but making a guest sit on the bottom step in a dark area was a bit much. To add insult to injury, as I left this morning I struggled to get down the steps as 10+ students were blocking them…. Yet one female can’t eat a sandwich on said steps.

Cleaning: Filthy rooms, duvets are not exchanged from guest to guest, the bedroom sink full of hair and dirt.

Shared bathroom: Disgusting, the bathroom box had dirt that stayed there the 3 days I was there, the space for the shower is tiny, the floor is slippery because of the water, there is no space to change clothes, and it's extremely cold.

Bad,"I “upgraded” from a shared dorm to a private room, which cost $137/day. The private room had one extremely basic, cheap bunk bed, a table with chair, and sink with faucets that did not work. The only lighting in the room were two overhead dimmable lights that never reached full illumination. The only showers on the floor were not working. I had to either go up a floor or go to the basement for the larger shower room. Although it was chilly in London (30s and 40s F), the heat only ran from 8:00 pm to 8:00 a.m. I had to wear several layers of clothes to stay warm when working in my room during the day.

There were other problems with the hostel, including staff who seemed to have no knowledge about the workings of the establishment and the laziest cleaning staff I’ve ever encountered. They were still cleaning my floor until 8:30/9:00 p.m. - probably because all they did was text on their phones and gossip.

I gave my card and room number and said you can check with reception that I paid but was told it’s okay but then the member of staff asked another member of staff if they had seen me pay and they said no.

My wife was first  hesitant when we booked however upon arrival we were both surprised how comfy, clean and safe this place was.

For our use we had reserved 2 lower  beds in a small room about 3x3m, with two bunkies.  Solid steel,  metal-framed beds that did not squeak at all 😉

During check-in I asked receptionist to let just two of us stay in that room. She accommodated our request and for all 4 nights we were alone enjoying the privacy.  

Nights were still cold so I asked at reception for extra blankets. To my surprise, I was given robust electric plug in heater that made our room very comfortable for the whole night.

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS THEY HAVE RATS - I would give a 0 rating if i could.,"Where do i start. The staff were unhelpful when things were wrong with our room. We paid for the best room and got a room that was one below (so we were overcharged for our stay). Our room was so cold that my teeth were chattering. There was debris on the floor, the curtain fell, the windows wouldn’t close properly so there was still a draft, the bedside lights didn’t work, the bed was so so loud and uncomfortable. There was loud music practically all night and drunk people walking past our room shouting and singing at like 3/4am. We were promised a king sized bed and a desk and bath but we got none of these, instead they gave us two singles for US to push together ourselves and they didn’t even align due to how small the room was. They had obviously given us a room that’s meant for 1 person. When we asked what the price difference was and for some compensation or to change our room and she (i think her name was Fernanda) avoided the question and refused any sort of refund and said they were “fully booked” so instead i had to ask for some extra towels to use as an extra blanket because they were “struggling with linen” even though i checked if they had available rooms to book for the night (which they did) so they would’ve had spare duvets and gave us free breakfast which was definitely the worst breakfast i’ve ever had at a hotel in my entire life, also we were greeted by some lovely little rats scurrying around trying to get left over crumbs while we were trying to eat our breakfast (i have video evidence although it won’t let me add pics or vids to this review for some reason). No warm food at breakfast either. When we first arrived the guy at the desk ended up making the the people in front of us cry because he didn’t want to help her amend the booking because their website booked it in wrong.

Bad,"I'm here to report the worst experience I've ever had with accommodation.
The room advertised with photos on your app was far from reality. The room I was given had a window that wouldn't open, so there was literally no air circulation. It smelled of sweat because of this. On the first day, as it was raining in London, the room started to leak. The wooden locker they provided for clothes was on the floor and got soaked, making many of my clothes wet. When I went to the reception, they said they couldn't do anything because it was a structural problem and they were fully booked, so there was no other room available. They offered breakfast as compensation, even though I lost half of my suitcase contents due to wet clothes. The breakfast was worth only 9 euros.
Since the room had no air circulation, they provided two plug-in fans, but there weren't enough outlets because people were using them to charge their phones (which is understandable). So, we couldn't use the fans, and the room was like a sauna where no one could sleep.
The staff: every time I went to the reception to complain about the water leakage or lack of air circulation, they said they couldn't do anything and could only offer free breakfast. One staff member even suggested we leave the door open (how can you leave the door open in a room with 10 people trying to sleep and with constant movement?). It seems the Generator thinks a 9-euro breakfast compensates for a 150-euro room that isn't fit to host anyone. especially for the rude staff and disrespect. When addressing these issues at the reception, they even threatened to kick me out without giving me a chance to retrieve my belongings.",,1.0,July 2024,"July 8, 2024",Bed in 10 + Mixed Dormitory Room,3,Solo traveler,6.9,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.0002510839322664421

Hotel facilities: As a Generator, no kitchen, which makes your stay more expensive as you cant buy and cook in the hostel. All areas need a good renovation, worn carpets, sofas with holes.
Room: I booked a female shared room for 8, they put me in a 12 room, and said that's they only type of room they have. My room 011, smells terribly, I'm under the impression that some of the guests are permanent guests, which is weird. The room as the rest of the hostel is dirt and needs renovation.

Wealthy Generation,"sorry, no time to write, flight leaving soon....","I did not do adequate research beforehand*, whereas I would have learned that guests are forbidden (!) to bring food from outside into the hostel, and there is no guests' kitchen.
  [  * I partly blame Booking.com for this because the format of the information provided for the hostel info appeared not to be following the format of the hostel profiles I've been used to, where the intended guest was lead to proceed through the relevant info that would have made clear the nature of the joint it is, as regards the facilities I wish to enjoy from a 'real' hostel, of which having at least a basic guests'-kitchen is one of those foundations.  ]
  I had only flown into London Heathrow, travelling lightweight, on a ""visa-trip"", to acquire fresh passport stamps, to document my departure from and then return to, Germany, in order to continue my current stay in Germany, (very much extended thanks to Covid to over two years), for a further three months period.
  I was not impressed by the sort of prices being asked for of hostellers intending to visit London, and the word ""money-grabbers"" springs to mind.
  Anyway, I had paid for what was thankfully only the first, of the intended two nights I'd planned to stay in London before the next cheap flight to return me to Germany. Before considering to pay Generator any more, I did not 'check in', but instead I went out to look for a more suitable cheap place to stay, and I ended up at a suitably priced bargain place I had stayed on previous visits. 
  I am disappointed that ""The Generator"", (the generator of greedy-wealth no doubt), seems to have got away with keeping my payment for having provided me with NOTHING. They failed to be a satisfactory and/or cheap, accommodation.

I had to complained about it to one of the black security man and a few minutes later he kicked me out of the hostel although it was almost a midnight. Generator in London doesn’t like complaints. The staff is poorly managed with the exception of bartender and cafeteria staff; they are friendly people.  I had been stayed in Generator in various countries and only in London doesn’t feel secure.

Furthermore, everything was broken or dirty, the hostel was sooo loud. You would be better to stay somewhere else for slightly more because they charge extra for everything!

Generator London made me homeless in London,Well I didn't like that there is a cobbled stone road leading to the Generator entrance. I mean a lot of customers will have luggage in tow when they come to the Generator and they would have to drag their lugguage over the cobbled stone road which is far from ideal!,"Actually with this booking, I was to have my girlfriend join me in for a night and I was booked in for a week at Generator. That never happened because my own booking became something out a horror movie. I turned up to check in and I had the front desk person looking at me as if I had poop on my head.
Next thing I am being handed a card to say I MUST write down my email address. I was far from impressed with the manners of this reception person and the request that I write down my email didn't help.

I said I had already provided my email to booking dot com and how come they couldn't get my email from booking dot come.


Next thing the reception says I cannot stay at Generator for my one week booking if I do not give them my email address.

Apparently my driving licence ID was irrelevant and my email address was the most important requirement for check-in.

I turned to the second chap at the reception to intervene. And that fellow goes ""nothing wrong has been done"" and the first chap was right to treat the way he has.

At which I lost it. I said to the second fellow, ""you are worse than he is"". And next thing this second fellow is saying he knew I was trouble the moment I walked in and that he will check me out. So I said ""check me out"" and the second fellow who said he is the manager goes on to tell the first guy to cancel my booking and check me out.

And do we know what time it was?

Well this was almost midnight!

I turned out on the streets of London to be homeless after paying for a week's stay at the Generator, simply because I had objected to the manners-from-hell of our 2 Generator reception people on Wednesday!",1.0,August 2023,"August 25, 2023",Bed in 4 Bed Dorm - Shared Bathrooms,1,Solo traveler,6.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.781836943417186e-05
