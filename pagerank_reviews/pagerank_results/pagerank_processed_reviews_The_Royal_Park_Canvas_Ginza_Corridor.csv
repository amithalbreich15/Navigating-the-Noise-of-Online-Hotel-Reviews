A cool hotel in a great location,"The breakfast options for vegan are very limited. While they tried to accommodate me, I ended up canceling the rest of my breakfast reservations. It’s more affordable and easy to pick up breakfast at the Starbucks across the street (they had good vegan options). 

Note of caution. While I like a quiet hotel and didn’t have any issues, the hotel bar seems to host a few parties and the bar is a local destination for people looking to party and hang out. This makes the check in are a bit crowded if you’re looking to do anything at the registration area. Again, I had no issue and did not find that this disturbed the noise level in the hotel. Its just a watch out for anyone trying to avoid crowds.",It’s a very good location - close to lots of shops and restaurants. The room was spacious and had nice touches like the wall projector.

"Spacious room, convinient location","I stayed in Omiki room, and the bed was quite lower which was very close to the floor. It would be better if the mattress was a little bit higher.","The location is very close to Ginza metro station and airport limousine bus station. Staffs are extremely kind and helpful.

A really comfortable and welcoming stay in Tokyo,My room overlooked a busy train line. I believe the window was double glazed but there was sometimes a dull sound of passing trains.  No other negative aspects come to mind. I believe there was a DJ in attendance for social activities near the reception area but in my room at night I was unaware of music being played.,"It was my first stay at this very new accommodation which was chosen because of its location for a specific event I was attending in Tokyo.  It was perfect for that activity with good access to the Tokyo Metro system and hundreds of restaurants within a short walk in many directions. The room was well designed, a moderate size as with many Tokyo hotel rooms but not cramped either especially for one person. The storage space was minimal but sufficient for my basic essentials.  Instead of a flat screen TV, there was a video projector attached to the ceiling. With a little assistance from the technical staff at the hotel, I was able to stream video material from my iPhone and iPad on to the wall, a lightly textured grey paper but not affecting the brightness of the image significantly. Wifi worked well. A good shower with ample hot water. My room overlooked a fairly busy railway line which could be heard distantly during its working hours. If someone requires complete silence, perhaps a request for a room on the other side of the building could be suggested. Although I didn't try the food near the reception area of the hotel, I had a couple of meals in the Italian restaurant on the ground level and these were very good. In the neighbourhood were all manner of culinary treats from Japanese seafood to Spanish, Indian, Cantonese, Vietnamese and other cuisines. I look forward to another stay at this hotel. The room was a comfortable temperature at the end of Autumn. I could wash essential clothes and they would be dry within 24 hours, a very great consideration when travelling light.",10.0,November 2023,"January 22, 2024",Moderate King - Omiki,15,Solo traveler,8.5,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0018823048763981587

As the hotel is located opposite the Ginza Corridor, you can find many restaurants along the corridor and it open until very late. From the hotel, it does not take long time to walk to Ginza Shopping street. Very convenience.

Good,"Having to check in electronically, even though the reception desk was manned - the last thing we needed after a long flight! We noticed people arriving at other times were not asked to do this so the policy is unclear.

Wonderful,The hotel overlooks Ginza station which means there is a constant noise of trains/high way. All the superior /king rooms are on the side of the building that faces the tracks so something to bear in mind. The noise isn't really that loud (we were on the 7h floor) my husband wasn't bothered by it at all but I am a really light sleeper so we asked to change rooms and the staff was incredibly helpful and arranged that for us.,"The hotel is new with a beautiful decor. Rooms are spacious, confortable and well equipped (including various usb cables and a cromecast). We liked the bar with music. Excellent internal soundproofing, we couldn't hear anything from the other rooms or music from the bar.

"Great location, and decent size room.",,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at The Royal Park Canvas Ginza Corridor, and I must say that it exceeded my expectations in more ways than one. The standout feature, undoubtedly, was the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff. Their warm welcome set the tone for a fantastic stay right from the beginning.

The hotel's location was another major highlight. Being within walking distance to numerous attractions and conveniently close to train stations made navigating the city a breeze. This strategic placement allowed me to explore the vibrant surroundings with ease and without the hassle of long commutes.

What truly impressed me was the array of dining options available within close proximity to the hotel. It's a food lover's paradise, with a multitude of eateries to choose from, offering a wide range of cuisines to suit every palate.

A remarkable aspect of The Royal Park Canvas Ginza Corridor is their commitment to sustainability. The concept of providing guests with the option to take only what they need from the reception, thereby minimizing wastage, is both thoughtful and eco-conscious. This approach aligns perfectly with the values of modern travelers who prioritize responsible consumption.

Even the skincare products provided were of surprisingly high quality, a rarity in many hotels. It was evident that the hotel takes pride in providing guests with a comfortable and enjoyable experience down to the smallest details.

The convenience of having laundry facilities available on the premises was a game-changer, allowing me to travel light and still maintain clean clothes effortlessly. The affordability and ease of using the laundry facilities were greatly appreciated.

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to receive a voucher for a free welcome drink. This small gesture added a personalized touch to our stay and made us feel truly valued as guests.",10.0,July 2023,"August 7, 2023",Deluxe Twin - Canvas,4,Family,8.5,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0018241813135389064

Decent hotel in the heart of Ginza,"We paid for breakfast. It was not bad, but we were a bit disappointed. The options are limited and to be honoust weird combinations. We tried them all, but were never happy with taste or combinations. Note that the restaurant does serve great dinners (we went there once), so not sure why breakfast is not great. Recommend to make it easier with a buffet or more common options. The room was not cleaned that well (we found a sock from a previous occupant). The room was too small for two with significant luggage. We could have known perhaps, it is Tokyo, but the lack of closet space for two or even space to put a suitcase was unexpected for a four star hotel and question value for money.","Great location middle of Ginza, very convenient and trendy.

"Fabulous, spacious, clean hotel in a prime location in wonderful Ginza.","The beds are a little hard... but we found that across Japan.  It would also be nice if the Welcome Drink actually made you feel welcome, and was anything you wanted and also available whenever you wanted. I don't drink alcohol but it would have been nice to have a zero beer but that wasn't on ""the list for the Welcome Drink"". I had to have a cranberry juice which was a glass with about 12 cubes of ice in it and a thimble full of juice. It seemed like they really didn't want to give you your Welcome Drink. I had tried to get it at breakfast time (more suitable for juice) but they ""don't do Welcome Drinks in the morning"". Either offer a really friendly Welcome Drink of whatever someone wants, or don't do it at all.","We stayed at this hotel 3 times across our 3 week Japanese holiday (1 x 3 nights, 2 x 1 night), each time in a Moderate King Omiki Room. We found it to be really great for our needs for many reasons.  The rooms were wonderful - well, a bit strange as two were quite a bit more spacious (815 and 915) than the other one (808), but all perfectly adequate, scrupulously clean and well provisioned. Do-it-yourself Check In was easy and efficient. We didn't really use the bar or restaurant - we only redeemed our welcome drinks one time out of the three stays, as it's a bit restrictive as to what you can have and when. We did not find them intrusive in any way, and we also didn't have any issue with the trains nearby (we kinda like the sound of trains anyway). The block out blinds in the rooms are the best we've ever seen... you could literally sleep until midday and think it's 4am.  But the best part of all is the location - Ginza is (from what we can see) the best part of Tokyo for a tourist to stay. The food along the Corridor and elsewhere nearby provides so many amazing and great value options to sample the local cuisine (try Bistro Fukumimi across the road for one!). You can also stroll the wide boulevards at night and marvel at the brand label shops and funky architecture. We just loved Ginza. It's also easy to get to anywhere you want to with all the train stations and lines within a short walking distance (Yurakucho and Shimbashi on the JR line, plus Hibiya, Ginza, on other lines)... so easy if you are transferring to the Shinkansen at Tokyo only 1 stop from Yurakucho. It's also close (say, 20 min walk) to the wonderful Tsukiji Market and Hamariku Gardens.

If you want to keep more than maybe two suitcases open on the floor, you'll want to either spend more money or stay in a less central location.
Not sure why, but they won't help with shipping items out from the hotel--you'll either have to arrange for pickup yourself (in which case the hotel winds up playing middleman anyways), or walk your package over to the nearest convenience store which is like 20 steps away from the front door--they'll accept normal parcels but not luggage.","Very comfortable lodging.

"A nice, value-for-money stay in an unbeatable location!","The fixed breakfast is, shall we say, a little eccentric - being a Japanese imagination of an Italian breakfast (or maybe that was an Italian imagining of a Japanese breakfast).  Soup, lettuce salad, fruit, pasta, ham and breads.  We found that a lot of what was served was not eaten, which is wasteful and costly.  We would have instead preferred a few more slices of their very good sourdough and fruit bread with some jam.","The Royal Park Canvas Ginza Corridor is very well located, just 100 - 200 metres away from the Ginza shopping strips and several subway entrances.  The location is a little more than walking distance from Tokyo Station if you have luggage (a taxi from the station cost us only Yen 1000).  Our room was on the side street, which I think is a better location if you are worried about noise (and we were there on a Saturday and thought it was a very quiet area).  The rooms although small are larger than I expected, with a double bed in our case and a small sofa.  The bathroom was on the utilitarian side; functional, a bit like a phone booth, with a lovely shower rose!

We've read some reviews about the staff not being especially helpful or engaging - that was NOT our experience at all.  Instead the staff went out of their way to try to understand our question and would bring in a more proficient English speaker if need be.  We needed to ask the front desk about storage of luggage after we checked out, as well as calling a cab for us when we needed to leave, and in each case they were very helpful, giving us clear, precise information.

Also: no cappuccino or anything, only black coffee from a dispenser. (Even though there was a big coffee machine in the back, they wouldn’t use it until after breakfast!!) 

Would simply not recommend the hotel, since the price is way to high for what you get. It’s not a 5 star hotel experience but more a 3 star hotel+.

"Ok for one or two nights, but no longer","The Royal Canvas, hotel Tokyo.  We had two rooms booked, one for our daughter Standard Double - Omiki, and one for my wife and I Moderate King - Prosecco, both rooms had queens size beds, ours the Moderate King - Prosecco was  a class above our daughter's thinking that we would get a better room, our room was slightly bigger but on the 6th floor, while our daughter was given the 8th floor.  In our more expensive room, we were disturbed all day and into the evenings with the trains, as our more expensive room looked directly on to the train line.   Our daughter said she could hear the music coming from the downstairs (2nd floor) night club.

 As we were staying for 7 days on the second day we asked if we could change rooms for a quieter room, they said we could, but it would be a bigger room and there would be an extra cost, considering we had booked 2 rooms for 7 nights i was very surprised.

Laundry, there are 3 washing machines in the hotel, of 12 floors, I asked if they had a laundry service, and they said they did not.  To wash, and dry ha ha ha, it took 2 hours (600 yen), Hower your clothes are not dry, it took another 3 hours (6 by 3 cycle's) of drying to have my clothes dried.  The worst part is the drying cycle is only 30 minutes.  If you want to wash your clothes why you stay here, be prepared to stay in the hotel for 5 hours and on the drying cycle you need to go down a start the cycle every 30 minutes.

The hotel needs to decide if it wants to be a hotel or a night club, anyone arriving after 8pm when the night club is kicking off has to deal with the night club when checking in (both are in the same area)

Breakfast finished at 9.30am and the restaurant had to be vacated by 10am.

Breakfast is the same day after day, no variety to the food, except the little cup of soup.  So after 7 days i felt like it was back in the army easting daily rations.","Good size room, for Japan.

Not a 4-star hotel,"This is not a 4-star hotel. I do not understand by what means this has received 4-stars, but the real rating is between 2 and 3:

- breakfast is not a buffet, it’s a ridicilous ”italian” breakfast that has nothing to do with italian food and portion is tiny. Also the last time to enter the breakfast is at 9:30, so no chance to sleep later. We had breakfast included but used it once and the rest went to search for a cafe nearby. 

- in the room there is no real bathroom, just a shower and toilet in seperate tiny rooms. The sink and mirrors are on the corridor, very unconvenient. Space in the room is small even if you pay more for space.

- no coffee machine in the room, something that you find in every 3 star hotels.

- instead of a tv, there was a projector that did not work because needed hardware updates which never updated. 

- no laundry service, only self service machines. Very unconvenient for those who do not want to stay at the hotel for 2 hours waiting for laundry to finish.

- also noises of the trains will be heard easily even on 5th floor, and weekends are party time on the streets which you will also hear.

Ok,"This hotel is hard to find because there are at least 2 with very similar names (owned by same people?). 

Room is quite small with no live tv. You have a projector that you can cast your mobile onto but thats it. 

No choice at breakfast but food is nice.

There is only one lift and one stair case at the hotel.

Worst thing for me, was the location. It is situated right next to a long street full of bars. Its great if you like going out drinking but if you are a light sleeper, its a nightmare. We stayed 3 nights and every single night there were drunk people screaming outside the window at 2/3/4am when they get kicked out of these bars. I could not get more than a couple of hours sleep because of this. Its not really something hotel has control over but maybe better sound insulation in bedrooms might help.

Look for a different place if you plan to stay in Ginza. Especially if you are a foreigner. You never know what they tal,"I know many of you who stay here may find this place ok, but it’s totally inadequate for the price you pay.

I was not properly introduced to the payment system, neither guided to the reception or payment machine. I was SUPER JET-LAGGED and disoriented. I was confused when I came to the reception floor because the place looks more like a bar than a hotel. Note to those who come for work or want to rest after spending a day around Tokyo - this hotel is quite loud. They have parties at the reception floor every day (a different DJ comes). When I found my way to the machine I got stuck during the process and it took a while when someone came up and helped me. (I was the only customer, there were 4 people working at the front and it was evening) I admit that I was tired, because I came straight from a 14h flight where I couldn’t sleep. That’s why I wasn’t able to focus, was tired and clearly needed an assistance. I didn’t look my best and unfortunately a staff member who thought  I don’t speak Japanese had to comment on my appearance to her colleagues saying that I look scary. Never encountered this kind of rude comment from a staff member in Japan…

I came for work to Japan this time and expected a smooth check in and planned to straight go to sleep. Unfortunately it wasn’t the case. Paying such a high price my room didn’t even have a bath… (a standard in Japan) I admit that it was my mistake because I didn’t notice it at the time I reserved the place. Again, inadequate price for the room I got and service.

They give the same breakfast over and over again. Staff didn’t bother to put up glasses for drinks. Slowest service I’ve ever experienced in Japan. Had to skip most of the breakfast days even though I prepaid for it… (used 2 out of 6) When you stay in Japan, you get what you pay for but not in this hotel. I was here for work and every minute counted. It was a very simple breakfast that can be prepared quickly.",-,1.0,March 2024,"March 10, 2024",Standard Double - Omiki,6,Solo traveler,8.5,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.0008228945862950882

"Avoid at all costs, worst possible experience I had in this country- sleep right on the train tracks","Like other have said about their superior prosecco rooms- they all face the train tracks and the super busy highway, the windows are so thin and badly made you can hear the people on the street and any bird flying by, after requesting to switch rooms since I am a very light sleeper the only option they offered was a half-sized room without the extra facilities I payed for, and no refunds whatsoever. Asking for any compensation for the loss of money was met with a sneer and unapologetic response that the higher price is not that much different- “4000 yen a night is not a lot of money”.. after countless hotels and 8 times of visiting in Japan I have never experienced such a disrespectful answer, I waved off their downgrade just in spite of not making them more revenue for their awful approach to their customers, I rather sleep in the middle of the highway, to add more the room smelled like someone passed out in it the night before, but honestly after the staffs comments I did not want to confront with them any more.",If you like to experience living right in front of the train tracks like a poverty house/homeless guy in the movies this is the place for you!,1.0,June 2024,"June 27, 2024",Superior King - Prosecco,3,Couple,8.5,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0007623665491848337

"жаркий отель, нечем дышать.","очень тесные номера, вещи разложить не где, на входе есть место открытого типа, где можно что-то повесить, под ним тумбочка с сейфом. коридор, он же санузел, раковина сразу, место для чая, слева туалет и душ. неудобно, нет разделения на входную группу и санузел, но разделен дверью со спальней. в спальне у окна кровать, примерно 150-160 см- малышка. маленькое пространство между стеной и кроватью со стороны ног- единственное место где можно положить чемодан. есть маленький столик и лавочка, с одной стороны у кровати тумбочка, с другой лампа с крошечным столиком и окно. это все из мебели. 
самое не приятное— не открываются окна. номер и весь отель сильно нагревается, дышать не чем. пришлось включить кондиционер на охлаждение, дует на кровать, но без него спать не возможно. в отеле даже в толстовке жарко. если учесть, что на улице зима и мы ходим в верхней одежде, то такая разница в помещение и на улице не радует. хотелось выбежать из отеля на улицу.","удачное расположение отеля, рядом отличные кафе, рыбный рынок, район больших магазинов.

Bad,"Pues después de cientos de hoteles que estado porque soy comercial aparte de hacer vacaciones pocas veces he visto un Hotel tan malo la recepción era muy pequeña y al llegar no había nadie en una segunda planta.
