"Excellent location, fantastic staff, great room","The building is easy to find, but the hotel entrance not so much.... It's tucked inside the little square beside Aladdin Casino so you don't see it from the street.... Worth the effort tho and easy once you know... Finding it the first time a bit challenging.. Lol
For the hotel itself only one complaint... We found the bed quite hard, even for Colombia, where extra firm verging on hard is the norm in most hotels. I love a firm mattress but this one took firm to an excessive level. We adapted though and managed to sleep well, even if it meant a few extra roll overs during the night.","Breakfast was great, also dinner at the restaurant. Room was spacious and clean with a fabulous view of the city with the mountains in the background. So many convenient things in the immediate area of the hotel in walking distance..we even found a late night club nearby to party and dance at, Piel Roja. And an Irish Pub just up the hill behind the museum. Restaurants, bars, pharmacy, convenience store all nearby. Street shopping vibe just a couple of minutes walk down Carrera 7 where the street turns into pedestrian shopping area with street vendors etc. Area of hotel felt safe with a strong military and police presence.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
Room wifi very fast, excellent ... Super important for me as I do some work remotely while travelling.",9.0,April 2023,"April 16, 2023",Deluxe Suite,4,Couple,8.5,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.002206110601602957
"Great hotel with large suites and convenient, excessive street noise comes through the windows.","The windows are single-pane and don't seal properly.  As a result, street noise comes into the suite even with the windows shut.  The noise level overall is very high - day & night (motorcycles, buses) on both east (orient) and west (occident).

On the east side of the building, there's a bar on the other side of the street that plays very loud music until 4 am on most nights, and this comes through the windows even when closed.  Some nights were karaoke so the sound is not always very pleasant to hear.

I stayed at the hotel a couple of times a few years ago on different floors, and it was the same level as sound carries up.

If that wasn't bad enough for noise, the hotel installed a party/conference room on the 4th floor, and there were several parties with very loud music from 6 pm until 10 pm a few nights.  We didn't know about the parties.  We couldn't use the suite during that time in peace - I couldn't work, I needed to make some calls and I had difficulty hearing the person on the phone due to the high level of the music from the party room (even with the windows shut).

The water system is problematic sometimes; it looks like it's due to heavy concentrated use.  On four occasions during our stay, there was no cold water available in the shower, the water was scolding hot, and it was impossible to shower.  We waited some mornings before the cold water came back - various intervals from 15 minutes to 45 minutes.  This was not an issue every single time so it's an issue with heavy use when the hotel is busy.

Street noise in Bogota is a problem on busy streets in general, however, at this hotel, the noise level was excessive overall and the hotel could benefit by upgrading windows.

We've stayed at this hotel a few times over the years however the next time we visit Bogotá, we'll be looking for another hotel due to the noise level that comes into the suites.","The suites are large and very convenient for the typical Bogotá tourist attractions.  The kitchen has a fridge/stove/microwave; however, it doesn't have any pots/plates/utensils provided.  We requested these and got the basics to make some quick meals occasionally (we were there for ten days in total).  

Breakfast was included and was buffet style.  Great value.  

The spa is fine and operated by a different company; the jacuzzi, dry sauna and steam room were included.  Due to the size of the hotel, we were told we could only use the spa every second day.  

There is a small gym with typical modern equipment.  It was upgraded since our last stay.  

The staff are friendly and professional overall.  

If you want a great view of the mountains, the east side is best.  

If you can withstand the noise (read what I didn't like below) then this hotel is a great place as the suites are big and so convenient.  Bring earplugs if you aren't a deep sleeper.",6.0,December 2022,"December 18, 2022",Deluxe Twin Room,6,Couple,8.5,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.002206110601602957
"Old but well kept apartment, badly equipped kitchen, good wifi, disorganized cleaning service","•The kitchen has less than the basics and that is a problem if you expect to cook during your stay because, even if you complain, they will not be able to bring you everything you need. In my case, for example, I needed a pasta strainer, bowls and a good knife and they said they didn't have them.
•The gym is small and does not have much.
•The apartments are cold and don’t have heating. The only way they solve it is by giving you a blanket.
•Regarding cleanliness: I do not like that the floor of the room is covered by a carpet; also, the carpet was completely disgusting. In addition, the utensils they used to clean were more dirty than clean. The surfaces and the bathroom were always very clean, but the floors were not.
It is very important to take care of cleaning, disinfection and vacuuming very well, especially when the accommodation accepts pets and considering that we are still living in a pandemic.
In conclusion, we had a good stay although perhaps I would recommend it more for a short stay. By the end I was already a bit upset by the carpet and the little glitches. But for the offer that there is and the quality / price ratio that you can find, it is not bad. What is certain is that the hotel would gain a lot of potential if it remodeled the apartments (I think it needs urgent restoration).","•Good breakfast.

Stay There,"The suites didn't have a kitchen towel or paper towel in the kitchen and no dishwashing soap. The housekeeping staff took care of all the cleaning and tidying up, so it wasn't much of an issue. I just like having the option because sometimes we ran out of clean dishes. The staff member who spoke the most English worked the not too busy shift. Not that it was a problem for us, but it may be something for other guests.","I am glad we chose here! The breakfast was superb. The restaurant's offerings were deliciously mouth-watering and filling. The pride in preparation was evident. The rooms were spacious and clean. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job. The taxis arranged by the hotel were reliable. The young staff member with the braces (sorry I didn't get his name) was the best at his job.

"Great place for a first time stay, few tweaks and it could be 4 stars","The rooms were outdated, and the furniture was so old and hard.

Barley anyone spoke English which could make it difficult for international travelers who have questions about the city.

While the service is supposed to be 24 hours no one really answers the phone you will have to physically walk to the desk or the restaurant.

While the breakfast was great it would have been great if they had labeled the foods for people with dietary needs. I also wish they had separate cleaner utensils. 

At times the water in the bathroom was scalding hot when you turned the hot water on a little and the pressure was really high, which was fixed on the last day of our trip.","The breakfast was actually pretty good, I loved the fresh fruit every day.

I didn’t like that we had to pay extra per person to be able to take the breakfast to the room one day that my husband was feeling ill.

The bedroom was very good size, functional with tables and chairs, the bed very comfortable, and the shower was excellent.

Good location with some flaws that may be ok for a short stay.,The pipe water was extremly chemical so if you tried to take a hot shower it was burning in your lungs which is no wounder if you ever tried to boil a liquid with chlor. Had to shave my beard since it started to smell like chlor. The noise level brutal. Especially to the side with the main road. There is no insulation so you hear every car and need ear plugs to be able to sleep. The equipment in both my apartments (had to change) were minimal with missing parts like a cutting knife etc. Many electricity outlets were broken. Some of the lamps were broken. Blinds were broken. The wifi was really bad. With a cable connection (for which you had to disconnect the TV) it was better yet not good.,Big appartments. Good bed. Clean. Great breakfest.

"Good room, but be very cautious with your personal belongings","An electronic device (a Nintendo 3ds) disappeared from our room while we were out, and the staff told us that they would look into it. We had to leave that day, but we had another 1-night stay planned a few days after, so they told us to ask about it during our second stay.

The surprise came when we returned and asked if they found it. Another person was in the reception, and he didn't know anything about it, so we had to start over by describing the console and when it was stolen. I gave them my phone number again and asked them to communicate with us about any news since we wouldn't be returning to the hotel, but we could come if they managed to find it.

No communication was sent to my mobile whatsoever after we left the hotel for the second time, so I ended up calling them a week later, and they confirmed that they hadn't found the item.

In conclusion, there was very poor communication with the staff, knowing the gravity of the situation.

Athough rated as five star hotel, I would say its closer to 4 start. The service is not 5 star because they don't have enough customer service staff at the lobby to address issues and there usually just seems to be 1 person dealing with 2 or 3 customers at a time.","The hotel toiletry facilities, suite and breakfast was good but the poor experience was all due to bed bugs.",1.0,January 2023,"January 18, 2023",Standard Suite,2,Solo traveler,8.5,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0.0017592553518872534

Very Good,"There are a ton of things in this hotel that can be mentioned, ranging from minor annoyances to more serious impediments:
1/ when you arrive at the address, there is nothing there. No sign, nothing. Unless a passerby knows where the hotel is, you won't just find it from the road
2/ the hotel is between busy roads on both sides; if you are sensitive to noise be sure to ask for a room on the 10th floor or higher; i got one on 5th and asked to be moved because it was seriopusly annoying; the windows are from 30 years ago, single pane and they don't even close properly - OK for a 3 star hotel in the countryside, but a little funny for what bills itself as a 5 star hotel
3/ no coffee machine or any tea in the room - no big deal, but for a 5 star hotel this is a bit ridiculous
4/ the staff do not speak great English; I am one of those travelers who doesn't think the entire world needs to speak English so I find this absolutely fine as a matter of principle; but again for a 5 star hotel it was at times quite silly how impossible it was to communicate with people at the front desk
5/ this might have been a temporary thing, but the hotel website and email servers were down for several days prior to my arrival. I couldn't contact the hotel for 3 days because the phone number didn't work either; when Tequendama Hotel (not Suites, a different place just up the road) finally gave me the phone number to Tequendama Suites, I called them and a staff member gave me the email for their airport transfer... but the email server was down so the email bounced back and I couldn't book the transfer anyway. Sounds funny? It is, except when you're really busy and wasting an hour on the phone and trying to figure out basic things with hotel staff who are not particularly helpful.

I had a good time at this hotel, so these comments are merely for travelers who want to understand both the good and less good sides of this place.","This is a solid hotel slap bang in the center of Bogota. It is not a 5 star hotel by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a nice place.

It was a vert disappointing stay.  Thank goodness it was only 1 night.  I do not recommend.,"We called several times requesting service in the suite and no one ever came.  Eventually my husband left to hunt down what we needed, which took a good 45 minutes

The hot water is BOILING HOT and I scalded myself, and the hot water handle was so hot you couldn't touch it to turn it off.  VERY dangerous for elderly or children especially.

Sirens blaring incessantly all day and night.  Must be close to a hospital

The furniture has certainly seen better days, not impressed with any of it, The TV's were too small for as much room as there was.  Especially in the bedroom which is very large and a good distance from the TV  For the price the furnishing should have been  better.

When I told the receptionist I was going out to find something to eat,, she told me it was dangerous and not to go to far from the hotel, and that almost everything within walking distance would be closed.  She was right.

The kitchen only had 2 large pans, no dishtowels, Nor  place to actually cook

Very dim lights, both in the rooms and in the halls.  In the halls they are motion sensor lights, but never came on when we came to our room, which was one of the first in he hall way.  It was too dark to see.  I got off on the wrong floor and tried to enter a room that wasn't mine.

You have to have an appointment to use the jacuzzi or sauna, which leaves out any impromptu visits.

Breakfast buffet would have been ok, but when we arrived about 9:15 it was out of a lot of food, and being replenished very slowly, and some things not at all.  No one came to my able and offered service of any kind, or information that omelets were available from the kitchen.  I guess you were suppose to order them from whoever was suppose to service your table or section.  I did see others having service of coffee, and when I was leaving was when I saw an omelet being served.  That was very disappointing.  That buffet should be full untill 10:00 am. as advertised

To much more to list.","It was spacious with a good door between the living room and the bedroom for privacy.

Not a place myself or my fiancé would ever stay.,"There was blood spatter on one of the lampshades.  the male front desk staff also said that they could get a woman to “stay” with me for the night (I was traveling with my fiancé who was not beside me at the time of checking).  In addition to that, the hotel windows (in multiple rooms) were broken and would not close properly.  Some of the locks on the doors were also broken, and the hallways (despite no smoking signs) smelled heavily of cigarette smoke.  

One of the female hotel staff also propositioned me (in an inappropriate manner) when showing me another room after reporting the issues with the windows (I took photos and videos of the windows to show the staff at the desk).  The other room she lead me to was not the room number on the card, and after going to the front desk again (upon seeing blood on the lampshade which I took photos of) they said they would refund my hotel stay though that refund has not been processed with my bank.

It seems that sex trafficking and violence is rampant in that hotel, despite the hotel policies against such things (which they have you read and sign upon arrival).

Do not stay here. Terrible and unclean hotel with subpar staff.,The room was dirty upon arrival and the room looked like no one had been in it for months. The bathroom was not clean and the cover for the hood fan was on the bathroom counter. The bathroom tub was clogged so water did not drain during showers. The room had a musty smell and the furniture was very old and not in good condition. The pictures on websites are very misleading and things do not appear the same in person. The staff were not helpful or even polite. I had asked if a late checkout was ok and the gentleman at the front desk told me that was no problem and said there would be no charge. When I came back and went to check out an hour after the usual check out time I was charged an extra $28USD after I was explicitly told the late check out would be no issue. It was a very disappointing stay after a long day of travel and the price you pay for the stay is absolute robbery.,Nothing really.

I would never stay in this place again or tell anyone else to.,"There was a friend from NYC that was in Bogota visiting family at the same time I was there. He came to the airport to meet me and help me navigate to the hotel. Upon checking-in I asked if it would be okay for him to come up. I was told it was fine. Because I had a large room with a pull out bed in the Livingroom, he stayed over because he would be taking me sight seeing the next day. The next day after we went sight seeing, he brought me back to the hotel. I went to my room he went to see his stepmother in the hospital and was coming back later. When he got back to my hotel, I came down to meet him but there was a problem. I asked the staff what was the issues and they COMPLETELY ignored me. There were three people there, two working the front desk, (a lady and man), and the night manager. When the night manger finally came over I asked him twice what was the problem and he looked directly in my face and ignored me both times and then walked away. The other young man never even looked me in the face. The young lady was checking out a couple. When she finally finished I asked her what was the problem, (I stayed at the counter until someone acknowledged the fact that I was the one spending my money and wanted to know what the issues was, because they were not letting him come up). She finally said to me, that he had to be signed in in order to go into the hotel. I said to her, if that is hotel policy that is completely fine but why was that not communicated to me the day before when I checked in and asked if he could come up and I was given the green light. They asked for his ID and he had his visa on his phone, he showed it to them and he was told that it was not a proper ID. They made him feel degraded and he had just come from seeing his stepmother in the hospital. I asked her why did the night manger  ignore me. Her response was because he does not know much English.",The breakfast was good.,4.0,November 2023,"December 2, 2023",Studio - Disability Access,2,Solo traveler,8.5,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0.00131630643637477

The spa was a disaster. It wasn't turned on when we came there. Then the hostess wanted us to sit in the jacuzzi first, I just wanted to go to the sauna. Then in the sauna she kept opening the door, and leaving it open, so it did not rise above 50 degrees. Meanwhile the steam sauna wasn't steaming at all. So we just left.

I already left Bogota and I still do not have the results of my Covid test, after I told them when my flight leaves.   To enter into the US I need the test taken within 24 hours of my flight.  I contacted the “ALIFE” several times asking for the results and the last comment I received was that the test yaks 12 to 24 hours for the result.

Upon check out I had to reschedule a other 6 day due to some appointments  . On the 2nd check in for a other 6 more days . We were  charge extra 80.00 dollars . I wasn't to happy about  that  being that I was looking forward in staying in the future at this place . But I look forward at a other hotel that was recommended  .

Regretfully heartbreaking.,"The following review has been written by my wife, Angela Mast:
This location is tarnishing the brand name ""Tequendama"" which is especially sad given that the franchise is celebrating its 70th anniversary. The showers turned on by themselves and they either burned you, or you froze. The towels are dingy and old. The paint on the walls has plenty of scratches and dirty marks, so does the furniture, which has seen better days and has no sense of decor whatsoever. The electrical appliances did not work. To top it all off, we were awaken at around 3:00 a.m by a very loud intermittent alarm, which went for so long, it finally forced me to go into the adjoining room where I had to wake my family up to call reception to stop it, because the phone accessible to us did not work, nor did the WiFi. For a person who has extreme trouble sleeping, it was a night from HELL. The free breakfast was thoroughly unremarkable and when we were exiting I was carrying a pan to bake the Thanksgiving turkey I had borrowed from a cousin and I was stopped by security who asked me if I had stolen it. As a native Colombian returning to my birth city, having grown up associating the ""Tequendama"" name with quality, only to have this dreadful experience was truly heartbreaking.",Absolutely NOTHING!!!!!!!!,2.0,November 2023,"November 20, 2023",Family Suite,1,Family,8.5,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0.0011350854194484112

"Not the Tequendama you’re looking for, book the other one","My experience with Tequendama was terrible. There are two hotels with the same name in Bogota located in the same area. By mistake I booked not the Tequendama where my family stayed in. And the hotels ARE located in the same area and have the same name, I’m not mistaken. I realized this fact within an hour of booking, but cancellation was not possible. The hotel refused to cancel my reservation although I spoke for a long time with them on support line and on the hotel reception afterwards (they told me I would still be charged for reservation). Support of Booking.com didn’t respond to my request. I would maybe forget about the situation in the end, but the receptionist called me a russian after seeing my Ukrainian passport. I could tolerate lack of professionalism, but not the insults. For at least three times less price I had much better places with nice attitude in Colombia. Here though the hotel knows about the mistake people make with confusing reservation and they do nothing to help and on top they give the worst possible insult. Wasted too much time on dealing with that reservation instead of spending it with my family. Good news is this Tequendama was my worst experience in Colombia.",Waste of time,1.0,May 2023,"May 28, 2023",Standard Suite,1,Solo traveler,8.5,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0005568996882391126
