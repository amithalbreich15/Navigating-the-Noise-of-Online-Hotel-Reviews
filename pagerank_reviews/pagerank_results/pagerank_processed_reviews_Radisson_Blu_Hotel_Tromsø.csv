Will come back for a third time.,Not full stars because they gave me a room for disabled people so everything specially in the bathroom was built  a little too low for me.,"It was my second time in Tromsø and also second time in this Radisson Blue. The location is perfect because it’s so close to everything and almost all the tours you book start from here or at least close by. The beds are really comfy which I don’t say often about a hotel bed. Everything is nice and clean and it’s really quite too. My experience they have the best breakfast buffet I’ve ever had in any hotel. Everything is fresh and you have a big selection.

"Great stay, nice hotel, good service and friendly staff","Not much not to like! We have stayed in this hotel a couple of times before so we know what to expect. It has always been great. Perhaps, a bath as well as a shower in the bath room would be nice. Sometimes the room is a little chilly because you can hardly adjust the heater.

Disappointing experience in a beautiful location,"We arrived at the hotel 10 minutes before check-in opened, after a 2 hour queue at the airport. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were advised to take a seat and wait until check-in opened. As soon as we sat down, a coach full of guests turned up and began to fill the lobby waiting to check-in. What we were not told initially was that the system was down and each check-in would take 10-15 minutes for the staff to do manually. This meant we had to wait for over an hour, whilst only two members of staff checked all of the guests in. There was no queueing system in place, and various people jumped the queue causing a lot of disruption in the lobby which was not handled by staff.

After we had finally checked in, we took the lift to our room and read a notice about scheduled maintenance on the check-in system. My partner and I have worked in IT for over 15 years, and there is a difference between an unexpected system outage and planned maintenance. Considering this was planned maintenance, there should have been more preparation and measures put in place to handle the volume of guests and speed of check-in. We missed a lunch reservation due to the check-in delays which was very disappointing considering this was our first visit to Tromsø.

We requested a double/king bed well in advance but were given a twin room with two single beds. When speaking to the reception staff, they advised we had to push them together ourselves and were not able to get a double duvet. We requested a double duvet from the housekeeping staff but were redirected back to reception. We did eventually get a double duvet after speaking with reception for a second time but this added to our frustrations.","Location of the hotel provided beautiful views from the room when booking the sea view.

Excellent location,The room was very expensive for such a basic room.  There was nothing fancy; it was all very plain and functional. We booked a double bed but got 2 singles.

"Nice hotel, but plan well.","I did not like how the reservation went. I called the hotel and was put on a long hold, then I was told to call back again later. Excuse me, why can't the hotel call me? The room price was very high. Then I booked through Booking.com and got a better price than from the hotel itself. Then Booking.com suggested I book a taxi to the hotel at a price three times higher than what it should be. That's because we were 3 people, and Booking thought, that each one of us was going to take a separate taxi. - Huge mistake! The hotel staff could not understand me when I asked for bus transportation. It kept telling me to take a taxi after I clearly said that I wanted the bus. The rooms are too small.

Then we needed help with moving our luggage to the room. The front desk said they had no such service and pointed us to a luggage cart. However the very person ahead of us, who had minimal luggage, was told they would take his luggage to this room (maybe that man was in a hurry 'cause he dumped the luggage with the front desk man and then went out).

Amazing in short. Highly Recommended,Nothing in particular,A 10/10 is a rare but this hotel deserves it by all means. The check in was seamless. The room was the best one could ask for with the view of Tromso. What a delight it was to see the beautiful city right from the bedroom. The fitness center was super nice and again the best view one could ask for. Really enjoyed the sauna. All Northern light tours start from the hotel and there is a decent Pizzeria nearby as well. The breakfast was outstanding. So many options and I also ordered Avocado Toast and Omlette which were really good as well. Definitely recommend this for staying in Tromso.

Good place to stay except for the inconvenience of having to go out looking for Restraunt’s,"Doesn’t have an in-house Restraunt which is a big negative for a 4 star hotel chain. The house keeping staff are a bit thrifty in so far as they don’t replenish the used toiletries. No drinking water was provided in the room , only an empty bottle to collect water was provided. Even if the tap water is drinkable, for some of us it’s psychologically difficult to accept collecting water from the wash room for drinking/ making coffee etc. water was not provided even after request.

The bathroom was very compact and barely adequate in size. Where the bathroom tiles met the wooden floor was a raised piece of wood dividing the two floor surfaces which was easy to trip over or stub one's toes.

Probably best vacation ever?,"+ Room service should improve.
+ Broken coffee machine at breakfast during our entire 5 day stay prompting queues. 
+ No blackout - for a city with uninterrupted daylight during summer, I would expect a stronger effort into securing the maximum degree of darkness for a superior night's sleep experience.
+ No airco in the room. I understand Tromso is very cold and climate change at this latitude might be a very recent phenomena, but when you get a room with a huge glass window overlooking the sun side the whole day in August, it can get really warm.
+ I had purchased an upgrade to superior room with sea view and was given standard room with sea view at check in. Not a big deal, as soon as I realized and complained, I got changed rooms immediately. Maybe good to remind staff to thoroughly check what's in the passenger's reservation to avoid them the hussle.

All in all, a super recommended hotel which I'll come back to for sure.","+ The amazing, breathtaking, unique, impressive view of the sea and the city and the port and the bridge made our holidays unique and unforgettable. Thanks, Radisson Tromso! This was a GIFT to our hearts.
+ Location is everything. Hotel is located in the very heart of Tromso 20 meters from the sea line, virtually all tours and excursions drop you or pick you up literally at the hotel's entryway so there isn't a better place to stay in this city. 
+ Very complete breakfast with a variety of choices.
+ Speedy check in and check out process.
+ Rooms well isolated, no noises, bangs, screams, or weird sounds coming from the aisle oe neighbouring rooms.

Excellent Location,"Getting into and out of the shower/bathtub could be difficult, especially for a person with mobility issues or older, like me. The bathroom was quite small and tight. 

Limited English programming on the television. We could not get any streaming to work on the tv as the WiFi signal was a little weak in our room. 

No towels provided in the fitness center. 

While we didn’t have such a room, be aware that some rooms look into other rooms directly across the small alley. Privacy may be an issue should you be assigned such a room.

Good,"Unfortunately a big negative point were the missing parking possibilities.

However, on our return- it was a queen bed when we got to our room. They wouldn't change this, despite what we had agreed earlier. The reception staff said they couldn't guarantee.

From the moment of arrival, the welcome at reception was fabulous, the young man who attended us realized that we spoke Spanish and kindly explained everything to us in Spanish, that's extra because you don't need to do it, which I really appreciate.

"Great location, disappointing Radisson hotel","The hotel has no restaurant services (apart from breakfast) and no bar.  There is a pizzaria and pub just around the corner associated with the hotel but you are not supposed to take anything back into the hotel which is frustrating.  The hotel itself looks tired and the cleaning in some of the common seating areas can be improved.  The furniture in these areas is also looking shabby in places. We upgraded to a sea view room which was ok, we could see the sea once the cruise ship sailed away but it had minimal drawer space (2 very small ones about 5ft off the floor) and no wardrobe albeit there was an area you could hand clothes.","The breakfast was good and there was plenty of seating.

Tenth-anniversary vacation and we couldn't have been more happier about our decision to stay at this,Breakfast options got a bit boring after day 3 since it seemed like the same spread.. But hey thats on us for staying for a week :)...,Stayed for a week at this absolutely fantastic property. Views from room 416 were fantastic. Waking up to views of the snow-clad mountains and the sea view was such a dreamy experience.  Staff at the front desk were always courteous and very helpful.  The location is fantastic and less than a minute's walk to most pick-up locations for the tours.  Airport bus drops you right in front of the hotel and local public transportation is available behind the hotel.   Radisson is a brilliant property to stay in Tromso.

Too nosiey to sleep - a shame as hotel is generally nice,The room was extremely noisey as the walls are very thin. Generally we were so tired it didn’t bother us too much as we fell into a deep sleep however on our final night the noise was unbearable. There was loud banging and what sounded like drilling. It kept us awake all night. Upon checking out in the morning I raised this and the person on reception said they’d raise this for us and be in touch. Nobody got in touch with us though and nobody responded to the emails I also sent about this.,Location was great.

The amenities for hot drinks don't include milk; as Brits, we favour tea over coffee but Europeans don't seem to drink tea that much, and if they do, it's flavoured without the addition of milk so just something to bear in mind if you're a (British) tea drinker.","I loved the aesthetic of the Radisson, I always do! Tromso was no exception. We got a free upgrade which was unexpected but very welcome. Our room was spacious for two people with lots of lovely amenities such as a kettle, nice toiletries and such.

Disappointing,"I have been using booking.com over a decade with no complaints whatsoever. Radisson Tromso was a big disappointment. Our group was six including our children and their spouses. We booked two superior rooms with Sea views to accommodate three guests each, in July 22. The photos at the site also showed spacious room with three single beds. On arrival, the front office took a long time to process. When the card was requested, I realised that the charges was more than the amount confirmed through booking.com. The front informed that they had no category of rooms to accommodate three people and the extra cost was to accommodate the additional persons in the superior rooms with a queen bed only. They said the information provided by booking.com was not accurate after showing the print out of the confirmation which clearly stated the booking was for three people in a room. We then insisted on seeing the rooms and found to our surprise that they were rooms meant for two and adding a bed will make it congested. Instead of adding a bed at extra cost we then asked for an additional room at additional cost. The room provided was one for handicapped guests with no view and inconvenient. Radisson staff suggested to go through the website of the hotel to avoid these miscommunications in future.

I was well aware of that and that is the reason I asked the front desk twice just to see if it could be done and twice while looking at my reservation they said yes. we would not have cut our trip short if we were told that reimbursement could not be done.  this was their mistake and they refused to correct it. we were very very disappointed,location,3.0,February 2023,19 March 2023,Standard Room,4,Group,8.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0008680826518080022

Poor,"Very unpleasant experience.
1. We were told in chat(booking.com) that we can only pay by card, cash in full is not accepted. Upon arrival, I could not do this, as it later turned out, because I did not have a credit card. I have a Maestro. The hotel reserves money and withdraws it from the account upon departure. That's what they explained at the reception. But much much later, when I had came with cash to pay, they offered another method of payment by card! It's a pity that not all workers at the reception know about this. Because due to the fact that I had to withdraw money from an ATM and then change it into NOK, I lost 450 € just in commission. And the room from 1400 € turned into almost 2000 € in 6 days. Totally unpleasant.
2. There were pieces of candy and other rubbish behind the bed in our room. The first day or two the room was cleaned good, but after that they didn’t even take away the dirty glasses.","The staff at the restaurant were very nice and the guy at the reception named Christian, who explained what the problem was with the card, thank him very much.

Weekend in Tromso,"I’ll start by saying this is not a 4* hotel even if it might seem so. I actually don’t understand how they received the 4th star, the services are way below. 
They have no room service, no hotel bar - if you need anything outside their breakfast hours, you have to get out of the hotel and buy. There is a pub next door which seems to be the hotel’s, as well as a pizza restaurant that looks inside like an American cheap restaurant. 

Rooms don’t have slippers, neither bathrobes and they’re very small for the money you’re paying. I’ve stayed at 4* hotels all over the world, I wouldn’t recommend this one.","Comfy beds, clean rooms. We payed a lot per night for the smallest room they have & the bathroom was flooding when you would turn the sink on, so they gave us another room which was bigger and more well-equipped.

Great location.,"We decided to upgrade to a standard room with a view and unfortunately, when we arrived the window looked directly onto another part of the hotel. You couldn’t have the curtains open as you could see directly into one another’s rooms and only if you leant to the window and craned your neck could you see some of the water. We queried this with the staff and they said they were fully booked and so we couldn’t change rooms. Admittedly, we spent little time in the room so it didn’t matter too much but I would question the photographs and marketing they have of their ‘sea view rooms’, I’m sure some of them are wonderful but this isn’t consistent; had we known this in advance we wouldn’t have bothered upgrading and just saved the money (roughly £55 extra a night).",Great location.,8.0,December 2023,19 December 2023,Standard Room with Sea View,4,Couple,8.3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0.0007964631281661213

Fuss-free stay in a brutal trip made easier by staying here.,"Location is a bit odd depending on what you are in tromso for, but tromso isnt that big of a city anyway, so nothing terrible by any metric.","I've stayed in quite a few radisson hotels and, while they are definitely not the cheapest option, they are consistently great, accommodating and quiet. The rooms are great to decompress and get some work done, and usually you have nice extra amenities like sauna, gym, ect (this particular one had both)
Breakfast is also very good, if you are around at that time, and they tend to have a pub that opens until late, which is great when you are doing short-ish stays and everything else is closed or a long walk from you (when you are on the clock, every minute counts). 
there is a tablet at the entrance to book taxis directly in front of the hotel, at any time. This has been very welcome to get to the airport at terrible times with very minimal effort.

Unfriendly policies to booking.com customers,"We didn’t get the room we excepted. We  booked two standart rooms. On the pictures they were cosy with a nice view of the city. When we arrived we were “upgraded” with bigger rooms with no view. One of the rooms had a broken fridge and the other one had a hard noise from the ventilation. Actually, the rooms were the same price when I compared the prices. When I complained they gave me even worse rooms. I had the feeling that the boy from the front desk tried to manipulate us and had hoped that we are stupid enough and that we were  going to keep the old rooms. I complained again and we finally got two fantastic rooms with see view. But the boy from the front desk was obviously annoyed and was somewhat unfriendly towards me afterwards, which was totally unacceptable.

Disappointing,"In the confirmation was: room with Seaview.
The ""Seaview"" was an ca 8. floors high building on the other side of the street.

The hotel doesn't provide parking places. When you arrive late in the evening, tried after the whole day of driving, and should look for a parking space for one hour, it is just a nightmare. As an alternative, they have something like ""tunnel parking"", where you have to drive through half of the city center to get there.

A message for Mr Radisson from a Father of four who thinks you should be a better person and company,"I made the silly mistake of booking the wrong date 04 december instead of 04 January. I realised the mistake and got in touch with Booking.com and the Hotel via mail and phone. Both refused to change my dates blaming each other in a classic ping pong game of blame the other person. I am taking my kids for a special holiday to see orcas and the aurora boreal. Thanks to Radisson terrible service and refusal to help and Booking.com total lack of assistance I lost 600 euro. 
I know Covid has been hard for us all and normally people are more understanding. Obviously Radisson hotel in Tromso just wants your money with no remorse or compassion. 
Terrible service and terrible assistance from the people at Radisson Norway. 
I suppose it was my mistake but what problem can it be for a big multinational to change a date on a booking??????
I hope the owners of the hotel read this and make sure other people don't have to throw  their hard earned monies into the Radisson bank accounts just because they cant change a date. 
Knowing very well the terrible difficulties that the hotel industry has suffered in the last years I suppose the Radisson Tromso hotel must be really full and can afford to loose customers and get terrible reviews.
As a person who takes about 80 flights a year and spends about 100 nights a year in a Hotel I must say I have never met such obnoxious and unpleasant treatment in any other hotel. 
I hope this helps the owners improve their customer service and prevent other hard working people from giving free money to Mr Radisson.
Thank you.
