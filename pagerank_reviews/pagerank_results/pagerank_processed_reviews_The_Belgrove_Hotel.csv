"Excellent price for a tiny, clean room in a friendly central hotel opposite Kings Cross Station.",Damaged shower room door.,"Excellent location, friendly, helpful staff, very clean room, very reasonable price for a central London room.

I wouldn't stay here for a long stay. It is necessities only.,"The room was tiny, with some many tiny rooms crammed in, the walls were paper thin so I could hear the person over the corridor in their room and also the person next door. The shower was too small for me and there was a huge hole in the floor sort of under the bed. The bed was also tiny and when you opened the bathroom door, it was so tight the door opened and hit the bed.",It was in a really good location. A stones throw away from Kings Cross.

2nd time and still great value hotel,Nothing. We knew what to expect and we got it. We had the same room as last time and was great.,2nd time we stayed here. We love the location. Ideal if you come with the eurostar and you arrive late or leave early. It is on 1 zone so  you can walk everywhere or using the tube you are in  few minutes in piccadilly. The hotel is old-fashion but very clean and the staff is very friendly. It feels home to us.

"Basic but clean, and really lovely staff!",Some of the stairs on the way up to the room were slightly uneven and creaky. It didn't negatively impact our stay but it made me cautious of disturbing other guests while going to and from the room.,"First and foremost, the location is incredible! Which made the already reasonable price even better! My mum was nervous of going down the stairs from reception to our initial room (where the staircase wasn't as well lit as the room upstairs) and the staff immediately and without any hassle allowed us to switch to a room upstairs which was more manageable.

"Bare bones room but if you are only looking for a place to shower and sleep, this is good.","The stairs!!! Also, do not opt for rooms with a shared external bathroom.

The hotel was comfortable as it was in a central location and very close to the underground and train station. Regardles,"The rooms were very small. This was the third time I stayed in this hotel, previously having had a room for two people as well. This is the smallest the room has ever been. In one particular room the bathroom door opened into the bed leaving literally no room to walk around. Since we only used the room at the end of the day to sleep for the night, this didn’t prove to be a problem but it could be an issue for anyone needing a bedroom to use for the majority of the day. 

The room I had in also had a particular issue with the bathroom light. The light worked with a sensor that would turn on when it feels your presence in the room. The problem was that the sensor did not sense us when in the shower so we’d end up using the shower in the dark or having to continuously move our hand out of the shower to wave for the light to turn back on.",The hotel is less than 2 minutes walk away from the entrance to the king’s cross underground station so the location was optimal for easy traveling around central London. The staff were very welcoming and accommodating (they provided 2 extra pillows when requested).

Good hotel for a city trip,"Room, and in-room bathroom were a bit small, which is to be expected at the price range. As a tall person, the bathroom was almost too small though. Directly in front of my window was a quite loud heater/air conditioning system, which for people with light sleep may be an issue. The buzzer at the front door makes an electric sound that was still quite loud in my room.","The room was cozy, and the staff was really nice. The location was amazing, with Kings Cross St Pancras entrance right at the front giving you a quick route to all major sight-seeing locations via the tube and bus. For the price the hotel was decent, but it depends on what you are expecting. My room was about 5 sqm bathroom not included, enough for the single bed, a small closet and a make-shift desk on top of the radiator. Bathroom was about 2-3 sqm, enough for toilet, sink and small shower. The room and bathroom was serviced everyday, and was clean. As a budget city-trip, this is a good place to stay.",7.0,October 2023,"November 2, 2023",Single Room,4,Solo traveler,5.9,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.001142284329777617

I’m definitely not coming back to this one,"- Very old building and place
- Corridor smells like mold
- Water pressure is minimal, so if you have long hair and planning to wash it, prepare yourself.
- No hair dryer and no shampoo either
- Main door only open if there’s someone, not well prepared for customers to be able to walk in.
- Kitchen is…let’s say I wouldn’t use it, very old and the adjacent “dining room” has like a smaller area packed with towels/bedsheets etc
- The second day, one of our towels was changed (yes, only one, not both?) and I found a very nice long black hair…taking into account I saw the kitchen area and what was in front of the washing machine I just used my old one.

The bedsheets and the room/bathroom are clean but because the place is so old, it doesn’t seem clean, especially the furniture (nightstands and desk that seemed from 20years ago, not that I used them but the vibe they were giving was not nice).
The corridor smells like mold/humidity, luckily the room we stayed in didn’t.
The first night after walking all day long in London and being freaking exhausted, we came to see a note on the door that said “Sorry reception will be open again in 3 mins”. The poor guy had to go to another hotel to turn the heating on (double job single pay apparently). We didn’t have a key for the front door so we had no choice but to wait, luckily I was with my boyfriend and it isn’t a dodgy area, don’t even wanna think if I was alone and  someone was behind or something like that…
Overall, if you just need a bed and some water to shower (our shower was in the room), should do it. If you’re a bit picky you will not enjoy this. I’m more on the picky side, tried not to touch anything than I didn’t have to really touch, but that’s me.","- Very good location

"Disappointing hotel, Very helpful staff","From the outside the hotel looks quite presentable, unfortunately, the hotel rooms are quite small and the decor is badly in need of updating.  Our shower was very small and turning around you needed to be careful not to get burnt on the pipes.  The plughole drain covering had also been put in before tiling so the edge of the tiles around the plughole were rough.  Staircases up to the rooms were a little uneven and in places there were no handrails.  The double bed was quite small.  Unfortunately, there was some demolition work taking place on the building nearby which started at 8.00 am and vibrated the bed and the bedside cabinets. The floors were very uneven and squeaky especially from the room above.","Staff were very helpful.

Super convenient location but basic,"The toilet was clean, but tiny! I think anyone who was particularly tall or overweight would have a lot of issues fitting in. As would anyone with mobility issues, even if it was only crutches or a sling. There was also no mirror in the bathroom. The shower room was bigger, but again no mirror. There was also only two hooks to hang things on the door - which is difficult when you have to bring a towel, clothes and toiletries. They also didn't provide any kind of toiletries apart from a very small bar of soap so make sure to bring your own shower gel and shampoo. The room was fine, but again could have done with a mirror. Also, there were only two sockets in the room. So, if I wanted to charge my phone, smart watch, work on my laptop and watch the (teeny tiny) tv, I couldn't. The hotel itself could do with a facelift. The decor is all very dated and I'd say hasn't been updated in decades.  A new carpet would really freshen the place up. I paid £65 per night, which admittedly isn't expensive by London standards, but I would have expected a little bit more.","The hotel was very conveniently located.

"Central and cheap, so don't expect much","I wouldn't suggest this during summer months, I went in May and the room was pretty warm, no AC. Also as many reviews mention before, the walls were really thin and the streets loud, so there was a lot of noise, especially at nights. You can hear if people in other rooms sneeze, for example. I had lost one of my earplugs so I woke up a lot. I would suggest earplugs if you want to enjoy a good night's sleep. I didn't like the fact the the hotel was really old, the floors were very squeaky and the corridors really dark and narrow, but not something I couldn't handle. Not suggested for people that get scared easily. ;)","I had read all the bad reviews before booking so I was kind of prepared. I mean, you get what you pay for (if maybe a bit less) and there's no way you're going to find something good in central London for 55/60 pounds per night, so it all comes down to what your purpose is. If you want to just stay couple nights and all you care is a private bed to sleep, it's passable. The room was tiny but it had a bed, tv, and own sink and soap. The common toilet was clean.

"If you are a heavy sleeper and need a hotel with a great location, this might be the one for you.","The window in our room was located right above the garbage cans which meant that when we opened the window, there was a strong smell and we constantly had flies in our room. Also, the window did not close properly, and therefore, the nights were very cold and I ended up getting sick. 
The bed was very small for two people (I believe it was around 1.20m x 2.00m). Since we are both not used to sleeping in such a small bed, we had some difficulties having a good night‘s sleep. 
It‘s also important to mention that the hotel was very loud at all times. You are able to hear everything that the other guests are doing and we kept waking up multiple times a night. On top of that, the water pipes were blaring. Whenever a guest turned on the water in their room (shower, sink or flushing the toilet), we were disturbed by the loud noise.

- no lift
- no toiletries

Short. Out in the morning as soon as possible.,Everything. A shower not in a cupboard. Curtains that closed.,"My daughters and I nicknamed this hotel 'The Murder Hotel' because it was like a hotel on a TV program where someone might get murdered. Probably an unfortunate prostitute, to be investigated by a middle rate ITV detective.

The shower was in a small cupboard, in a tiny corridor between the exterior door and the bedroom. Bizarrely it had a shower curtain, despite the fact that one would have to shower with the cupboard door shut. An electric light, 30cms from the shower head would have added an extra frisson of danger, had I taken a shower. The thought of being barefoot in the shower however, was just a step too far.

There was soap in the shower. We were perfectly happy. Especially when we returned home on foot in the middle of the night.

Overall good for the price and location but cleanliness and amenities could be improved. Passable.,"The TV was made for ants and is honestly not worth using because unless youre sat within a meter of it, you cant see whats happening.
The shower was designed for people who can fit inside of a shoebox (I cannot), the bathroom light is on a sensor which sounds fine until youre in the shower and the light goes off and then you have to get out the shower to trigger the sensor again, no lock on the bathroom door which was a sliding door that didn't slide all the way shut.
No lock on the window which rattled and didnt stay open but that was fine because of the constant draught, heat was cranked up to max to counter the draught but that just made it feel like I was living in a volcano.
Someone had left a present for me in the toilet but it wasn't a very thoughtful gift that the hotel cleaners obviously didn't notice.
The floor of the room was wood flooring that looked like it was put together by someone who didn't understand how to actually fit the planks together.
Overall, passable for a 2-star if you're capable of ignoring your surroundings.","The hotel is directly opposite to the entrance to King's Cross Station (over the road) and is right around the corner to a burger King.

Door to the building is locked at night and you need to be let in by reception.
