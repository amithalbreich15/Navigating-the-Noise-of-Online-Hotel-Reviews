Good price option,"By cheap it meant no TV in the room, no kettle. They do not clean the room during stay for cost and environment purpose.

The kitchen could have been good but would need a  bit of maintaining as flies are all around.","Good location, cheap and decent.

A good hotel but not near the station,"NOT actually a negative but it was the first time in ages I didn't have a TV in the room.

Pleasant and Affordable Stay in Norway,"If you use the shower for somewhat longer, it ""floods over"", but it wasn’t too bad once we put a towel on the floor.

A small coffee machine with a couple of capsules in the room and a bottle of water for arriving guests would go a long way.
There was a snacks and coffee automats in the hall though (on the ground floor), but I’d be dubious getting a coffee from a machine that also offers soup as an option. :)","Rather small, but modern, clean and nicely set up room with a comfortable bed.

The price is also very reasonable for what it offers, considering the accommodation prices in Norway and in Bergen specifically.
I also liked their transparency, making it clear that the rooms would not be cleaned every day due to sustainability reasons, as well as to keep the prices low.

Very easy to find, uncomplicated check-in, staff available all the time if you need help, very welcome and lively place, but also quiet, if you need to relax and enjoy your privacy. Everything very clean, simple but nice and comfortable room (ours had a view of a nearby mountain and a big supermarket Extra just opposite the hotel - open every day). There is cleaning only if you pay extra but this didn't bother us during our 3-night stay at all. Extra towels are available at the reception if needed, we asked for a water kettle and could keep it during the whole stay. There is a restaurant where you can have breakfast/lunch/dinner, but we didn't use it.

Yes there is nothing the room, no electric kettle and side things, but a very very comfortable bed is equipped, wifi works perfect, the bathroom is big enough, clean, even a couch-like sitting place is by the window. Check-in/out process is totally automatic and easy. A restaurant is in the lobby, warm atmosphere, and if you need truly a help there is somebody always for help.

- Not possible to open the window of the room and the airconditionning was not working (it was a hot day) to give some aeration/fresh air to the room...

Really appreciated the window view for this reason especially at this season where the sun never really fully goes down.

Price is reasonable for Bergen with a comfy room and bathroom and a very practical common area (though you can't really cook there the microwave and coffee machine were a big plus) 

Self check-in and out (+luggage storage) on the borns is very practical and easy. You can still have direct contact with someone if you wish to or have a problem.

Also the towels aren't changed for the whole stay unless you actually go to ask for not wet ones. That whole thing is pretty awful and to be honest kind of rediculous. They explain the lack of tv and fridge in the room with the good price, but the lack of basic room cleaning is unexcusable with that price, it's okay, but not really that good.

We ran out of toilet paper which was in one of those locked cases which made it hard to see (as it was black) when we visited the host no one was there (we went in the afternoon) several other guests were also waiting for the host. We waited a while and then had to just get the paper towels in the kitchen as we didn’t want to wait any longer.

My main point is about the digitalization at this hotel. I think it is a failure, and shows that digitalization might go wrong.
Arriving at the hotel and checking in was NOT easy. The door was closed, and there was a sign that I should use the doorbell behind me. I did, and a young lady came promptly and let me in. My first thougt was, if there is staff present around the clock - why not staff a reseption desk?
The self-service check-in computer was impossible to miss. I had my code ready, and started the registration. It all went fast, but my room number was displayed in 3 seconds, than disappeard and the check-in computer spitted out a card with no room number, I could read a message that a welcome email was sent to me. I was so tired that I did not notice the room number. I cheked my inbox, but no email had arrived. I waited a minute, and checked again - still no email. 
I went around the corner, and found an office with two persons from the hotel staff. They were very friendly, and solved my problem in few seconds, handing me a paper with the room number.
So I asked myself again - why not have a reception desk, where a friendly human being receives you, give you a smile, and help you to check-in and give you a key and the room number. This approach has been used in hotels for hundreds of years, and there is NO NEED to change that, when you are paying staff to be present anyway.
I moved up to my room, which was quiet, clean, modern and new. But it was very simple - no wardrobe or shelfs, but just naked walls. No TV (!), and a very small bathroom.

NOT the reference code from Booking.com!

Another (minor) dissatisfier was that the hotel was a bit hard to find. 
Coming from the Bybanen stop you first have to cross a very busy road, via an underpass.
It took us a while to find that underpass.","Is Norway known for their wide range of budget accomodation? No, definitely not.

The interior of the rooms is actually quite stylish for a budget hotel.
The name of the hotel suggests that this is some kind of Japanese capsule hotel, but the rooms are actually quite spacious. 
Downstairs they even facilitate self catering, by offering a microwave and disposable plates and cutlery.
When you visit in summer, the blackout curtains are an extra bonus, as the sun sets late and rises early.

Nice hotel but parking situation difficult,"Room and bathroom were small and cramped, with a poor view. 
The Bergen Cityboxes are described on Google maps as “Citybox Bergen” and “Citybox Danmarksplass.” This is confusing, as they are both located in Bergen.
Citybox informs guests in advance of parking lots in proximity, however it was not clear prior to arriving that there is no street parking or Citybox parking whatsoever. Also unclear that the parking lot to the immediate right of Citybox (SolheimsGarasjen) is limited to two hours and users must pay before entering. The cheapest parking recommended by Citybox is Viken P, it is narrow and difficult to find because it is hidden behind a garage.

Ok but not the best location,Small room is way too small. I stayed first in a normal size room and it was a huge difference. The small one is maybe good for one night or just one person but not for a couple. You can barely walk in the room as all furniture is close together. The double bed has only access on one side of the bed. I actually didn’t really notice that I had booked such small room until I got in. So pay attention when you book. The location is not terrible but there’s nothing to see or do around the hotel. Plus it’s a 20 to 30 min walk to the city center or 15min with the tram.,Helpful staff.

"Modern, young feel","Breakfast was not included but we paid one day for it, it cost 165NOK. It was very very simple but good enough for the price. Only had black coffee, missed some cappuccino, for instance.
Also, the only place where we could put our stuff on top was on the bench next to the window or the table. They were both behind a big curtain that we had to open in order to get our stuff, letting the light in and also it was possible to see us from the street. I would love to have some kind of desk or such that didn't require me to open the curtains all the time.
Another thing is regarding the location, it is convenient indeed but I would prefer to stay more in the city center if the price for the stay were not so different.","I had stayed in the Citybox in Oslo before, I like the idea.
Very modern feel to it, with automatic check-in, a place that feels made to young people.
Conveniently located next to the tram stop, even though not exactly in the city center. Very fast to arrive to city center and even possible to walk, even though we didn´t. Also it is the same tram line that goes to the airport, that was very convenient as well. 
Room that we had was big with very comfortable bed, nice big window facing the street.

Great value for money for solo/  budget travellers,Wish there was more information given about all the amenities and how to use them upfront. A staff member to greet and check in would really help.

"Lovely city, disappointing accommodation.","Location. Be warned! There are two Citybox hotels in Bergen. Our directions from the station took us to one 500m away, only to be told ours was 3km out of the city centre. It was a very minimalistic hotel - one hand towel, no floor towel, no TV in room, no fridge, no drawers, tiny hanging space, etc. Okay for people just wanting a bed for the night, but we  were spending 3 days in Bergen and it's nice to have a few comforts to come home to at the end of a long day of touring. We had found Scandinavia quite expensive so tried to economise with our accommodation in Bergen.
