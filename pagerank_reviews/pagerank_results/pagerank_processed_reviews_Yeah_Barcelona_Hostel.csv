Exceptional,Didn't love that sink was actually in room but I understand why they designed it that way.,"Comfy hostel - beds with lights, sockets, lots of storage. Great shower in room. Nice lounge area. Breakfast available and good value for the spread available. Near metro, lots of places to eat near by - restaurants, bakeries, Lidl supermarket ( can recommend Malaysian restaurant down street). Felt pretty safe with 24hr reception, you have to be buzzed in and show your bracelet which is also electronic key to your room- and friendly staff. And that they have female dorms available is a draw for me. Would very happily stay again!",10.0,January 2023,"January 18, 2023",Bed in 6-Bed Female Dormitory Room,2,Solo traveler,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0008090797322982334
Overall stay was amazing best hostel I’ve been to so far !,"Only thing I thought was OK was the bars we went to for the bar crawl, not the best but the club was fun. The room shower is small and bathroom sink is outside so if you need to get ready early, everyone will hear you.",I love everything about it the staff were super welcoming the facility was centered and you could literally walk everywhere. Taxis were easily accessible if you needed them. Breakfast and dinner all 10 out of 10. The bar at night was a lot of fun and the bar crawl but that was because of the group we had. The room was awesome we had a small balcony looking out into the street.,10.0,April 2024,"May 29, 2024",Bed in 4-Bed Female Dormitory Room,3,Solo traveler,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0008090797322982334
Excellent first solo hostel experience,"The aircon in the room didn't seem to work too well, and the windows could only be opened by cleaners, so the room got a bit stuffy at times.","I was very impressed by the hostel's general atmosphere and cleanliness - at times it almost felt like being in a hotel.

The hostel is modern, clean, and has decent facilities. The lounge area is a nice place to spend time relaxing or working, the terrace has great views over the north of the city, and the kitchen and restaurant are good too. 

The staff are friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable regarding local attractions and getting around the city. There are too many to name them all individually, but Pablo's tours (day and night) were great, and all of the staff running the family dinners or managing the front desk (Felipe, Franky, Ana, Eli, and the rest) were lovely too.

The rooms themselves were great value for money. The storage for each bunk was more than sufficient, the beds were surprisingly comfy, and the en-suite showers and WCs were very convenient.",10.0,March 2023,"March 11, 2023",Bed in 6-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,4,Solo traveler,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0008090797322982334
Really great place to stay!,"Wi-Fi in room didn't work well, I needed to switch to my own data from time to time :(","I really enjoyed staying here for 8 days! I was supposed to stay for a shorter time, but I liked Barcelona and ""Yeah Barcelona Hostel"" so much I decided to extend my stay :)
Regarding the pros:
- Location, I mostly walked everywhere;
- The hostel itself is clean and nice, the first floor has work space;
- The €5 breakfast was really excellent; fresh breads, pastries, cold cuts, cheeses, oats, fruits, juices. etc. I usually prefer to go to local cafes for breakfast, but in this case I had breakfast at the hostel every day. Only the coffee from the coffee machine was so-so, but for this price it was acceptable.
- There was access to the kitchen and it was cleaned on a regular basis (the problem of kitchen cleanliness is quite common in hostels, but here there was nothing to complain about).
- The hostel organizes club outings and daily dinners, which allows you to meet other people! This is a good place to socialize,
- People working here have nice and friendly attitude, are super helpful and kind!

Overall, I had a pleasure to meet many great people there and would definitely come back again :)",10.0,October 2021,"November 8, 2021",Bed in 6-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,1,Solo traveler,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0008090797322982334
Excellent Experience that will make you fall in love with Barcelona!,"There is nothing I can say here, except that maybe the rooms could have been just a tad bigger. My 4 bed dormitory was very comfortable but did feel a little cramped.","Yeah Barcelona was probably one of the best hostels I stayed in during my 10 week trip in Europe.

The staff are particularly friendly, welcoming and try to make you feel at home. Yeah doesn't feel like a hostel it feels like a friendly hotel in the center of town. It is close to a metro station and the Sagrada Familia.

ROOM: The Air conditioning works like a charm. The shower and WC cubicles are separate inside the room which is convenient for the people sharing the room. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was great!

WALKING TOUR: They offer walking tours in the morning (11am) and I took one on Classic Modernism which was all about Antoni Gaudi. The tour was conducted by Pablo and he did a fantastic job of explaining things to us, keeping the group together, keeping us entertained with his stories and along the way imparting real knowledge as well. Pablo was funny, friendly and cheerful the whole time.

PUB CRAWL: I along with 44 other hostel residents signed up for the Pub crawl one night and it was just marvellous! We went to 2 bars (Mobsters) and 1 club (Sutton). I have not had so much fun in years under the watchful eye of hostel staff who ensured those getting too drunk were kept hydrated and made sure everyone was safe.

DINNER: Yeah offered a fabulous dinner at 12 Euros for a 3 course meal (soup + main course + dessert) and 2 drinks (sangria or draught beer). You can't get that much food at that rate at a restaurant in the city. I choose to eat on Seafood Paella night and the meal was excellent! The portions were generous and the evening boisterous.

BREAKFAST: The value of a good breakfast while travelling on a budget is underrated. The breakfast was 8 Euros if memory serves well and had everything from hot scrambled eggs and hash browns to flaky croissants, dense cakes and various types of coffee (from a machine), orange juice, cereals, cheese platters with manchego cheese and meat platters replete with ham and pepperoni.",10.0,August 2022,"November 8, 2022",Bed in 4-Bed Female Dormitory Room,3,Solo traveler,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0008090797322982334
Excellent stay!,The shower room could be a bit bigger.,"Excellent hostel! 
It's very clean, in a very convenient location, and it has a a floor where you can read books, watch TV or just relax with others.
The dorm rooms are very clean, and there is enough space to fit your luggage and a lot of other things.
You can eat breakfast and dinner for good price.
Last but not least, the stuff is really cool and helpful!

"Excellent stay, warm and helpful staff, comfortable beds.","Top beds could have a little curtain too, only the bottom ones have them.","Yeah Hostel is super comfortable, an excellent choice. Staff is very warm and helpful, location is perfect, rooms are great and the pool on the roof is very charming. I was working some days and the wifi is great, besides having plenty of places to sit and work from. Breakfast is also amazing and well worth the price!

Perfect place to stay,"Thin walls and party music in the night, could be very noisy, though we're ok with that. Another thing to mention is that the double bed is VERY HIGH. For someone shorter as 160cm it might be hard to get on, but we found a small ladder in the closet which helped us solve this small issue.","Perfect location! Walking distance to many famous attractions like Casa Mila and Casa Batllo. The metro station is 5 min walk away, plenty restaurants and supermarkets nearby. The room is also very clean, staffs are very nice. The breakfast buffet (which is included in double bed room reservation) is also nice, you can make pan cakes on your own and it was delicous : )
For it's price it might be the best room at this location. We had a great stay in Barcelona and would recommend it to everyone!",10.0,July 2024,"July 30, 2024",Double Room,5,Group,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0008090797322982334
"Awesome hostel, great people and good location!!",The only complaint I have is that the tile is very slippery getting out of the shower LOL,"Great location, friendly staff! The beds were really comfy and it was nice and quiet at night, with the option to go out on the night tour with the other guests! The dinner was awesome to meet people and socialize! Lots of great food options nearby too and metro was really easy to use! The walking tour by Mario was a lovely bonus! He took us to the Modernist buildings in the area and explained the recent history of Barcelona very well!

Exceptional,We didn't get a lock for room storage,"Staff were friendly. They let us use facilities before check-in time.
It was clean, nice looking.

A modern friendly hostel - you will not be disappointed!,My only recommendation is the main lighting in the room could be improved with more spot lights as it was a little dark at times to see but this didn't affect our stay.  It was lovely.,"We stayed in a very clean comfortable private room on the 6th floor and it was one of the best hostel's I've stayed in. Each bed has ample USB/plug to charge all travelling essential devices. The location is great, close to some main tourist spots and metro is 3-5 min walk.  There are some cute little restaurants and Tapas bars on same street.  Staff are extremely helpful and I can recommend the free walking tour with Leonardo. Dinning area and kitchen is very funky and the hostel has a set 3 course dinner (inc drink) each evening for just 12 euro's...great portions and is a bargain!

An excellent stay and an excellent hostel.,"Whilst I appreciate the safety concerns, the locking of the windows at night does make the room quite stuffy.  Maybe there could be a solution to allow at least a certain amount of ventilation during the night?","Certainly  Yeah is a hostel a cut above the rest and whilst a little more expensive than others, it is worth the extra money.  It is bright, clean, full of good energy and has an attractive and  relaxing lounge, great kitchen and a lovely roof terrace.  The location is convenient and it's easy to get to a lot of the main attractions on foot or the excellent Barcelona public transport system.  The rooms are spacious and bright, the beds well thought out with lots of storage.  The mattresses are bliss, quality, deep and comfortable.  I slept like a log.  Each dorm has it's own shower and toilet which is a big plus too.

The people staying were predominantly at the younger end of the scale but there were folks of all ages staying which made the whole place feel inclusive.  I'm in the middle age band and didn't feel at all out of place.  There's an exceptional breakfast available at reasonable cost, as well as an evening meal.  There are activities including guided walks and bar crawls, for those who wish.

Finally the staff.  Brilliant, each and every one them.  Bright, cheerful and helpful, especially to a foot weary traveller arriving a bit overtired and not really with it!

I highly recommend this Yeah Hostel.  And I'll be back there very soon.",10.0,February 2024,"March 19, 2024",Bed in 4-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,2,Solo traveler,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0008090797322982334
Very Good,"I was in a 4 bunk room, and on our floor each room had it's own bathroom rather than a communal floor bathroom. At first I like this, but it was a little awkward in practice. We had a room for a shower, a room with a toilet, and the sink was in the main area of the dorm. This meant if we had different schedules, using the bathroom, washing hands, and/or getting ready outside of day time hours could be quite noisy. There are other bathrooms on different floors, which I used to get ready when I had to get up really early, which was ok, just a little awkward. Otherwise, I really liked the place.","Great location in town with lots of easy access to transportation, attractions, and restaurants. Offers food, but I didn't order anything from the hostel. Nice longue area on the 1st floor. 24 Hour reception and friendly staff. The bunks had storage drawers under the bed, which were well oiled and thus quiet (nice when sharing space with others). The bunks also had a small shelf with a light and plugs (both prong and usb), which could be closed and locked with your own lock as well.",8.0,February 2023,"February 12, 2023",Bed in 4-Bed Female Dormitory Room,2,Group,9,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0008090797322982334

All round. One of the best hostels ive stayed in.,"Rooms are quiet and comfortable, however, ours was very narrow. There's only a few feet between dorm beds and the wall. There was nowhere to sit to get dressed/put trainers on if you had a top bunk. Barely room to get dressed at all, which leads onto the same issue with shower space, it is nice and hot and clean but very small. The shower curtain was only one foot from the door so was pointless to use. The door had pegs but they were small or broken so nowhere to get undressed/dressed privately or hang any clothes/towel in a mixed dorm with strangers. It was also quite dark in the room, I didn't mind this but it meant I was using my mobile torch to access my belongings underneath the bunk beds even in the daytime.","Clean, comfortable and modern.

Suggestions for possible improvement: additional step/handrail for the upper bunk bed, as it's tricky to get up and down, a curtain for the upper bunk bed for additional privacy/blocking out light if sleeping in day, occupied/not occupied signs by each bed, so you know if someone is behind the curtain or on the upper bunk trying to sleep (can't see to know!), better lighting in the toilet/mirror area, a more powerful hairdryer, an adjustable shower hose instead of one fixed in the ceiling, and a larger shower cubicle area so you can dry your feet properly and dress before leaving the shower cubicle.

I am happy I have chosen this place for my stay in Barcelona and I recommend it.,"The faucet under the shower was somehow broken and it was difficult to choose the right temperature of the water - was either very cold or too hot.

Also the tap water had strange taste, even though I was told it is drinkable without cooking I could not stand it. It would be nice to add in the room description that it's useful to take own lock to the storage place in the room.","Room was big enough for 6 people.

"Yeah Hostel provided a fantastic first hostel experience with friendly staff, comfortable accommodations, enjoyable soci","People that snore should be banned from using hostels using an internationally recognized system!!! This is not the hostels fault. Thankfully I have noise cancelling earphones so I could manage, but not everyone does.","This was my first hostel experience and I think I couldn’t have picked a better place than Yeah Hostel. The staff is super friendly and welcoming (thank you to Felipe who greeted me and made me feel welcome), rooms and facilities are comfortable and clean. The mattres is thick and comfy, and big enough for someone 2m tall. :) It’s also great that the shower, toilet and sink are separated in the room, making it possible to be used by more people at the same time. I liked the organized dinners and pub crawls as I managed to meet new people and socialize. A special mention to Wesing for being the coolest pub crawl host. (I sing, you sing, Wesing - I’m not sure that’s how you spell his name 😂). The dinner is great value for money at just 12 euros for a 3 course meal and several drinks. A big portion of paella was the highlight, which was tastier than one I got served at a restaurant a few nights after. The breakfast is also great at 7 euros for an all you can eat style buffet. You can even make your own pancakes! I also needed an iron to help with the inevitable wrinkled clothes while traveling and they have several available for lending. A laundry area is available too at 1 euro per washing or drying. The rooftop pool area seems great for chilling although I didn’t get to utilize it because I wanted to maximize my time out in the city. Lastly, the location is great as it’s in the center of the city, so you are as close to Park Guell as you are to the beach, for example.",10.0,July 2024,"July 28, 2024",Bed in 6-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,6,Solo traveler,9,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0.0007495926403136023

"Yeah Barcelona Hostel is great, has a central location and the staff is very helpful","The only thing that bothered me a bit because I was very tired and wanted to have some rest, was that it was a little noisy in the evening from the kitchen. My room was on the floor right above the kitchen.
I owe apology to the reception for not returning the key. I had it on my wrist but was in the hurry to take a taxi to the airport /Younes woke me up at 6 am and called me a taxi, my phone was stolen at La Sagrada Familia/ early in the morning and I saw it already in the taxi. Sorry for that, it happened unintentionally. I would recommend to Yeah to ask for a deposit - so it will be sure that the guests return the key for sure. Thank you for the trust but things happen sometimes. I promise to return the key by my next visit to Barcelona because it is 100% sure that I'll stay at Yeah again. Thank you, guys!","The room is spacious, WC is separate from the bathroom which is an advantage when there are 6 people in the room. I received the promised bottom bed. They have an elevator - very important for disabled people and the staff helped me with the luggage to the room. The luggage depository is a very good idea, otherwise, you have to look for a place where you could leave your luggage before you are checked in and use the time for sightseeing. I booked now a hostel in Bologna and they warned me that the hostel does not offer this service which is very inconvenient for travelers. Besides, they don't offer 24-hour service at the reception. This is not the case with Yeah Barcelona Hostel. Well done, Barcelona!!
They are all very good but SORAIA at the reception is special and very professional. She helped me to get my boarding cards and I am very grateful for her kindness.

"Highly would recommend for the experience of meeting people, but hostels in general not for me.","Not really to do with the property but my experience as it was first time staying at hostel I realised it’s not for me. I like my creature comforts and personal space. 
First night I arrived people were already sleeping and someone was snoring all night and someone came back from a night out at 2am and proceeded to have a shower and flood the bathroom as I discovered at 4am when I went for a wee. The next night I came back after 3:30am and tiptoed into bed and was woken up by people getting ready at 7am, slamming doors, cupboards and getting ready with no regard for the time of day or me sleeping so I had to put my headphones on so I could sleep for a bit longer before getting up.
In the day it was so quiet in the room I felt self conscious about my breathing or making any noise so it was stressful. I totally enjoyed meeting lovely people and absolutely would take away that going on a walking tour when solo travelling is a great way of meeting like minded people, but hostels are not for me.","The staff were most definitely the best thing about this place. Walking tour was great and gave me a chance to make friends other travellers.
The room was very clean and facilities great. Much better than I would have imagined a hostel to be. Even in top bunk I felt like I had privacy, a little shelf with a door, plugs and light. Bring 2 locks for the cabinets as these aren’t provided, however you can buy them at reception if you forget.
Little rooftop terrace was amazing as I spent afternoons after sightseeing mornings there sunbathing and cooling off in the pool. Be aware there are no loungers so bring towel to lie on.

The best hostel in town,There is no shampoo in the bathroom but it seems like they rarely clean the bathroom as I found plenty of empty used shampoo bottle. The beds are cofortable but the upper bed of the bunker is a little hard to climb on as there is nothing for you to hold on to.,"I found the hostel accidentally but it turned out to be the best experience in Barcelona. The hostel is 5 minutes walk from the nearest metro/bus station. You can easily reach the famous Sagrada Familia and the Gracia district just some blocks away. I chose the 6-bed mixed room which was more convient than I expected as the room was not full for the 3 days I stayed there. They had a spacious a very secure luggage storage for everyone, plus the luggage room to store your stuff after check out. The meals offered and the walking tour were also great. But above all of that you will find the most friendly and helpful young staff there who are always ready ready to listen and help you with everything, even in planning your trip and guide you to the proper places in the city.

Wonderful,These are details in a generally excellent hostel. The fact that the sink was in the same area as the beds. Actually some hostels do that due to lack of space in the room but it is not practical at all because you don't have privacy and you have to annoy others when you wash yourself especially at night. The elevator was EXTREMELY slow. Perhaps the slowest elevator I've seen in any place that I have stayed. And the WiFi had some serious issues and it disconnects many times. I used almost 1Gb of mobile data watching a movie because I didn't realize that the WiFi had disconnected.,The hostel was in a very good location near to almost everything.

"Overall, I had a great time and would love to return to Barcelona Hostel during my next visit.","Although I brought my own white towel to the hostel, the cleaning staff mistaken it for the hostel towel and took it from my room.

Nice place; overpriced as a lot of them in Barcelona; safe feeling,"The structure of the kitchen. If you happen to cook while the cook prepares a meal for the dinner (yes you can buy it but for me this long social dinner wasn’t an option) then you have almost no space to cook your own dish.

Separate and VERY small showers in the rooms. Lack of the shelves in them, clothes end’s up falling on the wet floor.

Extra tiny sink in the toilet would be beneficial. Otherwise you have to wash your hands at night in a room next to someone’s bed.","Great location, very comfortable beds with convenient storage space and the locker next to the bed.

Affordable stay in the heart of BCN!,"- 6 bed female dorm - room was quite dark and not enough natural light 
- pool size - smaller than it looked in photos. Was more like a jacuzzi size 
- lifts were slow 
- need more single or double rooms por favor!","Two things really stood out to me from this hostel that makes it like no other:

- They offered a free walking tours from the hostel (not in conjunction with any other tours). The historic tour took place at the gothic quarter of the city and what made it unique was that it was she first ever tour I've taken that gave me insight into the political unrest between Spain and Catalan.
- Location was impeccable! 15 mins from BCN train station by L5! Right in the heart of great food and a 24 hour convenience store opposite!  Whilst this may sound cliche as  other hostels may also be strategically positioned too, personally for me I felt the above was impeccable. 

Alongside the aforementioned, additionally, the staff were wonderful and the rooftop pool was great (pink??).

Your best option if you come to BCN! ❣️,"Even if the cleaning was good enough and there is nothing to complain about it at all, I noticed one day they didn’t take trash out and either changed the sheets - details will always count.
The rooms were a bit dark - it be nicer if there will be a little more of light!","By far one of the best hostels I’ve been in! Excellent location to move around the lovely Barcelona, amazing relation quality - price, nearby there are handy places to get stuff you missed, grab a drink, walk around, and Verdaguer metro station will be your best friend in your visit. You can have a huge breakfast for only 5 Euros, and enjoy the amazing activities the hostel has for your stay like walking tours and night parties to make friends.

Overall good experience,"They don't offer tea or coffee outside of breakfast hours, even self-serve, and if you don't pay for the buffet you can only have one complimentary drink. The fridge was placed in the kitchen that staff also used, so I didn't feel encouraged to use it to store my own food. The hosts didn't explain a lot of things during check-in. The rooms were also really dusty for some reason, it stuck to my clothes and was in my hair.","The rooms were clean and modern, and each room had its own shower and bathroom, making it much more private and comfortable. The beds were comfy too. The staff was very friendly and helpful and made me feel comfortable during my stay. The hostel offers social dinners that made it easy to get to know new people, and the food was really good. The breakfast buffet, however, was not to my taste as it didn't have a lot of variety besides pancakes, bread, cereal and eggs, but that's just for me personally. The hostel also offers ""walking tours"" guided by hosts, which was a great way to get to know the city in a casual setting with other people from the hostel.

It was okay. Would not recommend it again.,"I arrived at 7 in the morning at the hostel because I took the night bus from Bordeaux. I asked if I could pay for half a day and stay get a bed. I already did a booking for the same day but the checkin time was at 3 pm. They said they can't do that as their policy doesn't allow that. Then I asked if I could stay in the lounge area till the time city opens up because like where can you go at 7 am in the morning to spend your time? Guess what?? They said NO. Like what? All in all, I had to leave th hostel at 0730 in the morning EVEN THOUGH I HAD MADE MY BOOKING. THIS WAS BY FAR SHITTEST EXPERIENCE I HAD IN ANY HOSTEL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.

At the reception also, people were were very non caring. They gave more of hotel vibe than hostel vibe.  Out of 3 staff members I met during one night stay, only one smiled and gave helpful information to travel around the city.","It's clean, Superb Location, and the breakfast is worth every penny. Honestly, I went during the offseason and the stay was good but I had an experience that just left a bad taste. Also, the shower is was not clean and the room lacks enough light, making to room dark.

- they have a bar downstairs (where the breakfast and dinner is being served), sadly they don't offer any drinks there. So it looks cool on pictures, but it's not an actual bar.
- you can't open the windows/balcony doors in your rooms by yourself. Simply not possible, asked the staff member at the front desk and they said only the cleaning staff opens and closes it again. If it's open, you can't even close it by yourself. 
- the pub crawl (Sunday) was a bit underwhelming. Again price is a bit high (20 Euro for dinner + pub crawl OR 15 Euro only the pub crawl). We've been to 2 clubs (free entrance, included in the price) and got 1 free shot at the first club - where the beer has cost 6€...","Some positive key points: 
- The WiFi was very good
- The showers, they are in the rooms, are very good.

- there's a lounge with a big table and also a little desk where you can work 
- it's a 1 or 2 min walk to the nearest metro station Verdaguer and a 5 min walk to the Sagrada Familia. But it's quite the walk to La Rambla, takes about 20-25 Mins.

Hostel with a good potential but many issues,"Weird security: there is no way to enter the building until the receptionist lets you in. Why not use fobs?
No towels. Why do hostels assume people don't use towels? Why is this something paid extra? Ridiculous.
Weird housekeeping: every morning and evening a housekeeping lady enters the room (yes, simply opens the door and enters the room) to open/close the balcony door. Is this a kindergarten? Can't guests decide themselves when they want to have fresh air?
Sink in the room - why do hostels do that? This is a terrible, terrible solution. You will wake up whenever someone washes hands or brushes teeth, etc. Toilet doesn't have a bidet and a sink. How about hygiene? Not required at the hostel?
In general this is a hostel with a good potential, but all these issues are very frustrating.","Good location. Sturdy and comfortable bunk beds with curtains, which gives you your own ""cell"" space.

The people and activities here are amazing. 


I had my first dinner in the hostel and the food is so great. Meanwhile, with the fantastic staff, the vibe of the dinner is fire (Shout out to wesing, sorry if I get your name wrong man, you are the best). Wesing has such great energies and a big heart. If you got him in the bar crawl, you would definitely have an awesome time. Here, you will get to know people traveling across the world and make great friends. 

In the morning, I booked myself to the walking tour which has different themes on different days. The old town walking tour is absolutely fantastic ( shout out to Pablo🫶). Our guide Pablo is such a top notch and told us about the all the history behind those gorgeous buildings. Moreover, all the staff here are all very warm-hearted and friendly. Whenever I need advice for the place to go or directions, they are always very willing to help and thanks to them, I had a wonderful time in Barcelona (Shout out to Pablo again, man you are amazing 🫶).

Not good.,The staff were very good,"The staff were wonderful, but the room was really bad. It was small and there was no ventilation.

Unbearable experience and left first thing in the morning,"Unfortunately this has been an unbearable experience for me that only 2-3 hours after arrival, I canceled the rest of my stay at this hostel. I had to pay 2 nights plus a penalty fee, but I'd rather lose money than staying here. Note that this is not my first hostel experience. In the past I had stayed in hostels (both female and mixed) in 8 countries, so this is not a hostel newbie complaining about a brand new experience here.

Upon arrival everything was ok. Every time the card unlocks the door it makes some kind of ringing sound which would potentially wake up someone sleeping. I arrived around 22:30ish. Soon after I settled in the room, a guy arrived in the same room and immediately went to poop in the toilet inside the room. The smell was overwhelmingly strong and disgusting, but the window of the room cannot be opened. It is not allowed to be opened during the night, apparently, so it was locked. The entire room was filled with the pungent odour of this guy's poop right in my face. There was no way out. It is not the guy's fault, but who would have designed such a room with the toilet inside while there is no possibility to open the window? From the air quality point of view, the room is a giant toilet with 6 beds in it, enclosed, air-tight. I had to inhale this air while trying to sleep in bed and not to gag. And since the toilet is in the room, every tiny sound you make in the toilet would be heard from everyone in the room. Including the sound of wiping. And many other sorts of embarrassing sounds. 

More people arrived in the meantime and I soon realised that I was the only female in this mixed room. This felt quite strange, as the gender proportion is way off. I changed into my pyjama in the shower which is also inside the room, next to the toilet. It was a small, wet and awkward space, unlike many other hostels where the shower room is separated from the room and has much more space.

All above combined made me decide to leave ASAP.","- 2 out of the 3 receptionists were genuinely friendly

Good hostel,"I didn't like the airco. For me it was too cold. I had to wear a hoodie in the gaming /lounge room, because I was getting too cold.

The breakfast was okay, but not too much choice. It starts officially at 8,  but bread, fresh pastries and fresh eggs would come around 8:30 . No veggies at all. 

And of course I knew it was a hostel when I was booking it, but what I didn't take into account is that Barcelona is a very young/party/night life city full of young tourists. So all my dorm was going or coming back from partying loudly during the night. Or start packing the bags at 3am ( because that's when you do it). Anyway, I stayed for 7 nights and my sleep was awful. So if you're coming to Barcelona for work, think twice to book your stay in the hostel (any hostel in that case).","Perfect location, price, parking. Parking was narrow, but really doable.

Good hostel but not the best if you want to relax,"Even though hostel was nice my experience wasn’t the best. First of all because of the people there and their mentality hostel is almost like a frat house. Walls are very thin so you can hear everything from other rooms. And oh boy not only they talk loudly they scream all the time with random music even in the middle of night. And since the hostel is in nice location people are into party stuff. So they can bust into room at 5AM vomiting, shouting and doing other drunk irresponsible behaviors. In short if you want a relaxing experience and good sleep after exhausting day this is not the place.","The hostel has good facilities, almost everything you’d look for a hostel.

"It’s budget friendly, but don’t expect support from reception too much if something happens.","There was only 1 elevator, so I needed to wait for many minutes while the elevator went up and down to pick up other guests that pressed the button first. A lot of guest I talked shared the same frustration.

The closet that’s built in to the bed for dorm room doesn’t have any lock. I ended up buying one from reception m, which was 3 euro. I wish they told me about this beforehand so I can just bring my own. What’s the point of the “personal locker” if it doesn’t have a lock… smh 

There was a gap between my bed and the wall that was infuriating. I dropped my iPhone 2 time and it was very difficult to retrieve it. I asked the staff each time I dropped it, but first one didn’t help me, second one just gave me a pole that didn’t even fit the gap.
The person sleeping above me also dropped her phone while I was sleeping — it hit my head. That was VERY UNPLEASANT.","New and clean facility.

"Party-oriented hostel, no cultural immersion","The hostel, in particular the social activities, is geared towards a younger party-seeking crowd and I didn’t find it to be a very culturally immersive experience. Everything is in English and the staff responded in English when I tried to converse in Spanish. Some of the staff were a little rude and condescending when I asked for dining recommendations in the area.

The communal dinner was acceptable but not comparable in quality to what you would get by going out to a restaurant or bar. I heard from other guests that the paella is excellent, though.

I was on a top bunk which is significantly less comfortable and convenient, the rooms were hot at night and the heat rose. There is no privacy curtain for the top bunks. There is too much of a difference in value between top and bottom and the price needs to reflect this or the top bunks need to be made more comfortable.

There is only one washer and dryer and they seemed to be occupied at all times. When they were finally available, the washer left a disgusting smell in my clothes and the dryer didn’t completely dry everything after an hour and a half, and I had to hang things up in the room to dry.","The facilities were clean, and I appreciated the opportunities for social activities.

Wouldn't do again,"No one took COVID or any safety measures seriously, most staff and hostel guests especially rarely ever wore masks. Don't know if it's me, but the cheery dramatic attitude of the receptionists really got on my nerves when I asked for just simple favors, as little as asking for a towel or wanting to order breakfast. I was bombarded with a dramatic scene and questions about my origin instead of simply being handed a towel. My friend's bed was in questionable condition as there were food crumbs and piles of dust within the bed frame and even found a used COVID mask next to her pillow.
I brought a shopping bag from my home country and put it next to another paper bag I got from shopping at el corte inglés, the next day the cleaning staff arrived, all my bags were gone. To my knowledge they didn't contain anything valuable in them but on their own at least the first bag was valuable to me. All gone and no one's seen anything when I asked.
Windows cannot be opened overnight ""according to the Spanish law"" it says in red on the glass. Never heard of that law in my life, not even from a local but this lead to terrible air ventilation at night time which is a problem in times of COVID and living with strangers in a 6-bed room.
Oh and the room had poor lighting. I see the point of not waking up your fellow room mates by flashy lights but overall it was quite dark.","Kitchen, Lounge, and dining room open at almost all hours.

The hostel is not worth the price,"1. The hot water in the washbasin is broken and cannot release hot water. You can only wash in the shower every day, which is very inconvenient

Pleasant,"- At least 1.5 km walk to center 
- Rooms are dark and you can't open windows whenever you want. There is someone who is opening the windows everyday. 
- There was a man's boxer (dirty and belongs to previous guest) between the wall and my bed. I wondered how do they clean the rooms. 
- Common area is very limited and the terrace was close at 9:00 pm. 
- Bring your own padlock because they are asking for 3 euro if you wanna use theirs. (I thought that every closet would have the electronic lock because the hostel seems new but no, you have to use the old ones)","- Cheap if you are alone.

Bad,"First the room was really really small tiny for even 2 people not 4, the window do not open until 12 and they close it at 7pm. So when we wake up the room is full with humidity and smells,  there is no fresh air and we can't open the window,  the shower is inside the tiny room which is a bad idea, the cleaning woman come to the room once a day so in a room with 4 people that shower regularly I let you imagine the state of the shower, the hungers are really small they don't handle clothes,  the upper beds are very uncomfortable with the stairs that didn't make it easy to climb, I couldn't find anything positive about this Hostel beside the location and the friendly staff.",The location was good close to a metro station and to bus stops,1.0,June 2024,"June 20, 2024",Bed in 4-Bed Female Dormitory Room,3,Solo traveler,9,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0.00035429071197468765

"Good hostel, but they're starting to think providing a fridge is a favor instead of a selling point","Used to be a good hostel, but they're becoming complacent and starting to make arbitrary decisions, like restricted access to the fridge. Unlike before access to the fridge was unrestricted, I tried to give them a feedback that that’s what makes the difference between having a 9+ rating, or me commuting 15mins to theirs instead of booking other hostels downtown, instead of listening to the feedback they got into debate and made it sound like providing a fridge was a favor, you know there's a management problem when a business starts to think their selling point is a favor.",,1.0,October 2021,"October 23, 2021",Bed in 6-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room,2,Group,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8.773270065651281e-05
