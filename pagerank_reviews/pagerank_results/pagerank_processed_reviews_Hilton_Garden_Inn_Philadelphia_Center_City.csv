Location can't be beat; close to everything . Great staff and comfortable beds.,"There were no bath towels, soap or coffee in our room when we checked in; which was rectified immediately upon request .

"I was very disappointed, particularly when compared to my last stay in May of 2019.","Amenities - Swimming pool and hot tub were out of services. Lobby - Very drab when compared to my last stay i May of 2019. The lobby size was much reduced and bland with white painted walls. Guest office area was moved within lobby area as compared to 2019. Apart from being much reduced, there were fewer work stations and printouts had to be routed through the front desk. Billing - A $75 charge was booked to my credit card for a non-existent ""pet"".","Location - Great access to SEPTA for transportation within Philadelphia. Room - Good size, well maintained. Staff - Very receptive. Breakfast - NA.",5.0,May 2022,"July 16, 2022",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,4,Group,8,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0.0009779331800452294
Good,"The day I checked in and the next day I found that I couldn't log in the WiFi, the staffs at the front desk were not so accommodating. The first staff forgot to tell me my room number and charged me with a wrong room rate; the second one just solved the problem not so politely. The room is not soundproof. I could hear people talking and walking in the hallway.","the location is great, near many historical sites and museums; the room is clean and well maintained; the breakfast is good (though not offered in buffet form); the staff Tony at the front desk helped me correct my charge bill very efficiently before I checked out.",7.0,May 2022,"May 10, 2022",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,2,Solo traveler,8,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0.0009779331800452292
Great location! great staff!  just needs a few tweaks,"We were told on check in that we would have to ask for rooms to be serviced, which we did repeatedly
seemingly to no avail
so for 5 days we had the same sheets,same towels,no coffee milk or sugar for the machine
The USA seems a couple of months behind the UK regarding Covid , but expecting guests to stay in a dirty room for 6 nights is not acceptable
Eventually we coerced a maid into getting us some clean towels and bedding and serving our room,  this hotel should be on par with a premier inn in the UK but was double the cost  and hard work","The Staff were on the whole were Great, Frank at reception, Johnny and William at the 10th floor bar and restaurant were great guys,  Darius at Breakfast  and the older gentleman  doing the coffee, and  Tiffany and Yolanda (sic)the Maids  also were very communicative and helpful .  
The location is very central but also quite gritty,with plenty of  homeless people around (not the hotel's fault)  the security guys seemed to man the doors 24/7  and were decent fellas too
Breakfast was nice and a good start to the day  , the breakfast room is pure art deco and very clean and friendly",7.0,May 2022,"June 3, 2022",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,5,Family,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0.0009698204355166455
NOT RECOMMENDED!,"NEGATIVE:
1.Thought the rooms are smoke free but the first room they offered smelled smoke!!! I asked for a change and thanks to the front desk for switching the room immediately. Even the second room also smelled kinda dump but it was better than the first one.
2. Parking is expensive and charges $37 per day! 
3. NOT ALL, but one of the ladies in front desk was very impolite and unprofessional. I asked for complementary water and she started arguing without knowing my the room type and family size. 
4. Room Service was poor. We asked 3 times and finally the cleaning ladies appeared. 
5. Bathroom smelled really bad.","POSITIVE:
1. Breakfast was not bad. There wasn’t enough varieties but it was still good.
2. Location is excellent, right in city center, walking distance to shopping center and groceries.
3. Cleaning ladies (from Guatemala and Porto Rico) who appeared after my request, were AWESOME with very good, friendly and smiley faces. They cleaned the room better than we initially checked in.",4.0,August 2022,"August 14, 2022",Junior Suite,3,Family,8,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0.0009686598701721198
Fair,"We booked a large room for 5 people.  There were 4 towels, 1 tiny shampoo, no bedding for the sofa-bed, so we had to ask for that. We asked for no cleaning but did request more shampoos and coffee as part of the "" customised service"". We also asked for the bath drain to be looked at as it was blocked and the water didn't go down. Slight problem when the shower is over the bath and 5 people are staying.  None of these issues got addressed. We were showering while standing in cold water from the day before. 
There was a problem with the kitchen but there was an adequate continental breakfast.  However we were surprised  on Saturday night for getting a glass of wine in a plastic pint container then being effectively sent on our way at 9 pm as the bar closed. 
It's also astonishing how everything gets thrown away-paper and plastic plates, cups and cutlery everywhere rather than washing up, pretty decent melamine plates straight into the bin after breakfast. Not just at this hotel but most places we have found. So wasteful it's shameful.","It's a fairly modern hotel with nice staff.  Comfortable beds, quiet enough for It's central location.

It worked.,"Staff wasn’t very friendly or helpful when we checked in. There was no luggage cart available. They only had one for the entire hotel and they didn’t know where it was. They didn’t have enough bedding for the sofa bed, no pillow. Sheets on queen beds were too small. The body wash was broken off the wall. The parking was $40 per day.",Clean room. Comfortable beds.

"Comfortable Room, but Expensive and a Little Risky Area","There were groups of children and teenagers screaming and running up/down halls at 1-2am and lots of street noise, so the rooms are not soundproofed at all. They do not have any parking, so parking was over $70 at the next door garage for just 2 nights. There are no barriers for people on the street to be kept from coming up into the garage, so it felt like a huge risk the whole time. It is located in the inner city, so when we walked out of the hotel the first night we were hit with an overpowering odor of marijuana, urine, and human waste.","The hotel room was clean and comfortable. The staff were very polite and kind. The location for historic sightseeing is great, we walked to Independence Mall and basically everything else worth seeing in the DT area. They had security at the hotel door and only guests with keys could make the elevator go up to the rooms.",7.0,July 2022,"July 10, 2022",Junior Suite,2,Group,8,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0.0009632939047735642

"Good, but exorbitant expenses will prevent me from staying here again","The rooms are wildly expensive, and nothing is included in the stay! I paid $105 for two days of parking, on top of the room cost and on top of breakfast. Not to mention room service doesn’t dare enter your room unless you specifically go to the front desk and ask. It’s just insane. Everything else was great but the cost alone would stop me from staying here again. Gotta include some kinda perks after a guest spends $450 for one person for two nights.","The staff was very nice, the property was clean, location is great.",5.0,July 2022,"July 28, 2022",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,2,Group,8,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0.0009525204212280633
"overall had a cool and fun stay, just these hotel mishaps that weren’t okay to us.","unfortunately the security deposit was more than what was originally posted so we weren’t initially prepared. And because it is in the heart of the city, you have to prepare to spend a pretty penny for parking. I requested room service every other day, and they only showed up our last day as we were heading to check out. ￼so our garbage was full and we had to leave it outside prior to this for them to take it out and they didn’t even give us bags so we had to go request some.","our room was nice. nice floor, perfect room. and clean and we made sure to keep it that way.

Garden Inn Philly,"To make a list: no parking. You really can't park on the street but there's a parking garage attached to the hotel. Except you don't get comped and there's no in and out so basically took we ubers everywhere. We were there three days and our parking bill $111. 

Uncomfortable beds. Just overly firm and our backs were killing us. Also, related to the beds, we requested extra blankets and they never brought them. 

There is no housekeeping. If you want clean sheets or towels, you have to request it and you might not get what you asked for.

No continental breakfast. But you can by a single serve bowl of Fruit Loops if you like. The ""pantry"" was a joke. We had to buy our own snacks and there's only a limited number of restaurants in the neighborhood.   Side note: Iron Hill Brewery was great and the fish and chips was on point.

Speaking of the neighborhood, it's kinda sketchy at night and there are a lot of homeless people hanging out around the hotel.

Be very careful in the shower. There are no treads or anything like on floor and if you do not move very slowly, you could easily fall and crack a skull!

The cable sucked. There were barely any channels worth anything and not one movie channel. I mean, you're on a trip so you will likely be out for the most part. Still, after a day out and about, it would be nice to chill was something interesting.","We were in the middle of a lot of historical landmarks.

Great location and some of the staff was exceptional but…,"From the second we entered the room we didn’t have a working toilet for 75% of our stay.

The staff was not in any way welcoming about this They had these ridiculous signs where you could rent a table in the lobby for $75(!) for two hours, and only during hours the convention center is open. For these kinds of events, I expect the nearby hotels to be glad to have paying customers using their lobbies and other facilities, and not charged absurd amounts for add-ons you get for free at every other hotel nearby. I didn't see anyone using this ridiculously-high-priced ""service"" but I certainly won't be coming back next year if they keep these policies in place, despite how convenient it may be. The Marriott and Home2Suites nearby are much more friendly and open to their customers.

Overall it was a pleasant stay and served its purpose.,"Didn't like the parking situation. When you do find a parking garage the lots were tight to maneuver and full. We had a noise issue the first night there. We were next to the cleaning/storage closet, so there was a lot of banging on the walls. The room next to us, had 2 dogs and they left the dogs alone in the room. So for a few hours we heard either the dogs barking or whining. We called the front desk, they sent security to the room however, there was no person there to respond. Only made the dogs start barking or whining more.","Upon entering the lobby, it was nicely decorated and looked and smelled clean.

That was the only downside we had.",It was easy to find and parking was right next to the hotel or street parking was on the same side as the parking garage. Front desk staff was kind and welcoming. The beds were comfy. We were able to have all 3 of our kids in beds. Our teen got the pull out couch to himself.

Disappointing.,"The covers were too small for the bed, there weren't enough pillows for 2 people and they were too soft. The hotel/room looked dated even though there was an attempt to update it.

On another note, the hotel Asst. Manager did some sketchy things. They charged me for the first night and claimed that we were a no show, even though we arrived around 10pm on Friday and were checked in by 10:35pm (Hotel policy is check in is from 3 - 11pm). For some reason we were checked out on Saturday and someone else's name was on our room. The way we found out was that our keys didn't work. Even the front desk clerk was baffled because he said whatever happened the asst. general manager did it. After the hotel keys were resolved, looking at my bank account, there were several transactions on my account that were unauthorized. I ended up speaking to the asst. general manager who claimed that he was trying to fix an error in how we were checked in (said we were checked in under the wrong reservation - How Sway?). Then, he claimed that he had to put a 30% hold for incidentals (I have NO idea where that came from because the front desk clerk only mentioned a $100 security deposit hold). After reviewing the transactions on my account, NONE of those even equated to 30% of anything! Therefore, I called my bank to dispute every unauthorized charge.

My advice - I sure hate to say it but don't stay here. If you do, only use your credit card! What happened to my bank account was totally uncalled for, especially seeing that he didn't even reach out to inform me of any issues with our reservation. I would've never known what was going on if it wasn't for the issue with our keys!",The location and size of the room/bed.

Good,"Paying for parking daily (whopping $37 a day) and not being able to get any type of validation or discount was insane- especially since the hotel shares its parking with municipalities, and you pay a good amount for staying. If you left, you had to pay each time, as well. Plus, the parking lot wasn't the easiest to navigate; the elevator in the hotel only went to certain levels... which you don't know until after you park. If you aren't on their floors, you have to go out of the hotel and get the correct elevator; no easy feat when you have all of the luggage tugged along.","The place was amazing and the location was definitely a bonus.

Never again,"This was a bizarre stay. We had two issues that will prevent us from staying here again: 1). The overnight male staffer was unfriendly and made us uncomfortable with his attitude. We tried to get help with two questions and the 1st night we asked for extra pillows, he stated there were none and stated he could send a sheet for us to roll up!!! 2nd night, we kept calling and he did not answer at all. We asked the day shift for extra pillows and two were delivered within minutes and when we asked for late check out they couldn't be friendlier! Someone really needs to address this individuals behavior as he is a Frontline employee that represents your hotel - not good. 2) Our family went to the Garden Grill for dinner. We arrived at 8:10 and apparently we're in the midst of a fight going on between the bartender and the Chef. The poor waitstaff were trying their best, but the bartender kept leaving the bar to go back to the kitchen and over to a few tables. There were multiple tables that had to wait along with our table due to the ongoing feud. We were not served until 9:40 and we had our young grandson with us. Thankfully, the waitress and host got his meal to be finished first, but we had to wait almost 45 more minutes. The entire stay was surreal.

"Average rooms, extremely disappointing front desk staff, (excluding bell hop) wonderful staff everywhere else","The front desk staff, specifically the individual working friday evening/sunday morning, needs a refresher on how to convey friendliness and hospitality. I was greeted with no hello, welcome, good evening…but rather Name, no smile, a quick blurb about the restaurant and when i took my room keys and said thank you, not even a you’re welcome, enjoy your stay… felt like i was being processed into a correctional facility … i understand if someone has a bad day, but when early sunday morning came to check out, not even a silent smile ..so i dont know. I say this with sincerity, Hilton can save a lot of money cutting out the front desk and moving to a fully mobile check-in experience (with the ever growing advancement in AI)…so dont make it easier for them to get rid of a role that should enhance someones stay through kind and warm human connections. Do better, not for the guests or for hilton, but for your own livelihood. It really dampened the mood after such a long drive to be greeted so poorly.

Awful experience,"Pretty much everything else. The service was terrible. I was convinced by the reception desk officer that I could change my credit card during the check out,  which I couldn't do. I told her that she said that I could and her response was ""I deal with so many people and I don't remember you"". Incredible.  Besides, I'm still waiting for my deposit to be refunded to my credit card, which hasn't happened yet. 

Besides, I almost had to beg for my room to be cleaned one day (it was only cleaned after 5pm. It was literally the last one to be cleaned), even though I had asked at the reception since 12pm for the cleaning service.

I had booked a king room in April.  The staff offered a double room instead.  I told them that wasn’t a satisfactory solution.  After waiting for 30 minutes past the check in time the staff was able to upgrade my room and I was able to check in.  I was only able to get one key for the room due to issues programming the key and was promised by staff that one would be brought to my room - it never arrived.

Good,"2 things.
1. It’s advertised as having parking. When you look further into it they say there is a garage close to the property that is $40 per night.

Upon arrival I was informed the garage has nothing to do with the hotel despite that they are attached, and the parking garage has hotel directions inside.

I was also told it was $40 dollars per day which was steep but acceptable. My expectation was to spend $80 for my two days.

Upon exiting the parking garage i was told by their employee that there is no day pass so every-time we stoped back at the hotel for an hour or so we were hit with an additional hourly fee. Unfortunately at this point i didn’t have any other options. So the actually payments to the garage totaled double that. 

Not the end of the world financial wise but it’s not  right to advertise parking and give people wrong information and then get bamboozled upon arrival. 


2nd complaint is employees hounding you at the elevator to join their rewards program. They were polite but it got to the point of annoying.

The hotel itself was clean, the rooms were very nice. The area wasn’t great but they did a nice job of not letting that affect the hotel.

2. I left my scarf behind. I called the hotel roughly 1.5 hours after I had checked out to let them know so it could be retrieved. I was promised by the front desk staff that my scarf would not be thrown out - that it would be put in the housekeeping office lost and found once it was retrieved and that it could be mailed back to me. My information was taken down and I was told to call housing keeping the following day. I did exactly that, and no one answered so I left a message with housekeeping with the front desk. I called the next day as well, got a hold of someone from housekeeping and (after giving a very detailed account of exactly where I had left the scarf) was told that someone would go up to the room to look for it and that I would get a call back. Never got a call back. I called again two days later and couldn't get a hold of housekeeping, so I spoke to someone at the front desk, gave my info again and a description of my scarf and where I left it and was told that housekeeping would be notified and that I would get a call back. Now, nearly a week after I have checked out, NO ONE has called me back OR told me what has happened to my scarf. Frankly, I'm less upset about the scarf at this point (I can only assume that someone has taken it because NO ONE has told me yet that it has been found). What I am VERY UPSET about is the run-around I've been getting and the lack of honesty. If my scarf has gone missing from where I left it, I would like to be told the truth. If someone has taken it (which I suspect is the case at this point), I like to be told that it may have been the case. I have been patient and I have been understanding and trying to put my faith in human decency and have hoped that an honest person turned my scarf in....",The location was great.,4.0,February 2022,"March 5, 2022",Queen Room with Two Queen Beds,3,Group,8,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0.000677440567819906

Racist hotel,,"During my stay, I encountered two instances that significantly impacted my perception of the service provided. Firstly, on Friday approximately 3 am, I called the front desk to report noise disturbances from neighboring rooms on my floor. Regrettably, the staff member who answered the call was extremely rude and dismissive. Instead of addressing my concerns professionally, they seemed to scoff at me and even raised their voice.

On a separate occasion, I experienced unwarranted rudeness from a staff member when I attempted to pay with a different card. My decision was met with unnecessary questioning and skepticism, which made me feel uncomfortable and undervalued as a guest.

What's more concerning is that in both instances, there was a lack of apology or acknowledgment of the inappropriate behavior. Despite being subjected to raised voices and unwarranted questioning.

I sincerely hope that these interactions were not influenced by bias or prejudice. However, the treatment I received, coupled with the lack of apology, has led me to believe that racism may have played a role in these incidents.

It is imperative that all staff members are trained to handle guest inquiries and complaints with empathy, respect, and a genuine desire to resolve issues promptly, regardless of their background.",1.0,March 2024,"March 23, 2024",Junior Suite,2,Family,8,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0006540955752323526

NEVER AGAIN,"I am a photographer, and booked this reservation weeks in advance. After writing a note to the hotel requesting a room on a high floor, and if possible, a view, instead we were given a room on their lowest floor (7) with no view. In addition, over our 3 night stay, we NEVER had hot water - only tepid, at best. Our room was 135 steps from the elevator. Our view, as shown in the attached, was of a wall. I'm not sure why this hotel, which should provide cozy, warm rooms, allows maintenance to place icy cold light bulbs in rooms when they have a choice of warmer energy saving bulbs. Of course, no housekeeping services for the room were provided due to Covid, which the hotels are now milking for all its worth to save money on housekeeping. One evening at the front desk when we requested two coffee pods (they are not replenished daily - you have to ask for them), we were told they were out, and only offered decaf. What kind of service is that? The pool and Jacuzzi were closed, and we were shocked to find that the main entrance to the hotel was under a covered street (appearing dark, unsafe), when no mention of this was made in the photos of the hotel. The seriously over lit lobby had a giant screen TV, and was anything but aesthetic or comforting to return to daily. One more thing: I have read, and am starting to believe based on this stay that hotels place guests booked through Booking.com in their most undesirable rooms. From this experience, I'm staring to wonder about that.  Calling this place a ""Garden Inn"" is preposterous! And for $200 per night, we felt really ripped off.

"This hotel is in a great location, but is not worth the cost.","Google search and Booking.com led us to expect the hotel to have an indoor pool.  To be clear:  we searched for hotels with indoor pools and included breakfast.  We chose this hotel from the search results. Desk staff stated the pool has been closed for four years, the small buffet breakfast actually cost $18 per person, and that the Hilton corporation has no way to advise travel booking sites or Google about the misrepresentations, and suggested we only book through Hilton in the future. Parking is not only extremely expensive, it's very difficult to get to and from the hotel to the adjacent garage.

Low Standard business hotel located right at the convention Center,"1.) the breakfast area is disorganized: The staff is not able to set the tables in time, when there are more than medium number of customers. 
—> better skills, more attention to customers and better attitude by supervisor is needed!
2.) the reception staff is unskilled, when it comes to anything outside the routine.
—> to ensure a good welcoming attitude at the reception, better skills is required to enable a more individual handling of the customers‘ needs.
3.) the breakfast itself is poor (irrespective of coupons or Menue): lowest quality bread and jam, egg liquid instead of real eggs, no cheese or meat for the toasts, terrible utensils.

Bad. Being a loyal customer I think booking.com could have resolved the issue.,"by mistake we had booked the room for 21st night instead of 22nd night as we had done the booking from Dubai. This mistake happened due to the time difference between dubai and US.

We requested to change the date to 22nd night and also spoke to Booking.com representative Ms. SIBA . I also spoke to the assistant General Manager but he said that I have pay for 1 more night if I had to stay for 22nd night. 

Since rooms were available I think Hilton should have changed the reservation to 22nd without any additional cost. Being a very loyal customer  I expected booking.com would take some initiative to resolve the issue but the response was not as per the my expectation. Going forward I will look for other options
