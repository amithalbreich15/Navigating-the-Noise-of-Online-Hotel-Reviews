Cheap but not cheerful,"Catfish photos. Images as presented, but what you see in the pic is what you get with about 20yrs worth of short term guests stays added on. The decor and colours are extremely depressing, everything here could do with a facelift. My room also wasn’t properly cleaned.

Unfortunately I had to use it or freeze to death.","Great location, and extremely friendly and personable staff. They have a licensed restaurant/cafe on site too.

"Easy, clean and comfortable. This is a great stay for a work trip or weekend in the city.","I got probably their worst room, however it was very cheap, comfortable and worth the price. It is located against the carpark so you may hear tires on concrete if people are coming and going.

A nice located hotel and convenient to the city areas with Elizabeth Quay and train station @15mins,The front office staff were not responsive to our request that our neighbouring room at #49 was quite noisy late into our first night.

I had a lovely stay and would definitely stay again.,"The hotel is in the chinatown district of Northbridge. I didn’t know this when I booked. There are 40 restaurants within 1km of the hotel, all Chinese / Japanese / Vietnamese / Korean etc. I’m allergic to 90% of Asian food, so I was disappointed that the hotel’s restaurant was also Chinese and Japanese food. It made no sense when there are so many restaurants doing the same food in the same area. There were 4 choices of western food on the menu, but all were unappealing and previous reviews from other customers said they are cooked on the same utensils as the Asian menu. This meant I had to walk 2.5km per day to the city centre, past all of the asian restaurants in the area (the smell of the cooking would set off my allergies, so I lived off antihistamine), or order menulog to be able to eat, so it became very expensive. A shame because if there was a Western Menu or Room service with basic things like sandwiches, i’d have eaten at the hotel every day.","Staff are lovely, room was clean, tidy and comfortable.

Disappointing,"BUT the following points is the worst experience during our living. 
1. I still can’t find the Wi-Fi password in my room. 
2. The sunlight is bright enough (we can’t close it completely) for us that we can’t sleep well. 
3. The most annoying thing is the noise from the machine that sounds like Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.  (Not from the air-conditioner or refrigerator. ) We barely can’t sleep because of the noise. We even can’t find where it cause so we just sleep with the failed symphony.

very poor and fraustrating experience. I wrote an email and no response for weeks.,"I booked 2 nights at your hotel. Unfortunately I had the worst experience ever.  

 

The first night 4am, I woke up by a vibration noise of the wall and my bed and couldn’t go back to sleep as I need to wake up at 6am that day. I didn’t put too much thought on it and thought maybe a heavy truck drive by and caused the noise.  

The second night, after a full day of busy work, I was looking forward to a good night sleep. I went to bed around 10pm and the same vibration noise appears again. It sounds like a motor vibration in the room wall and my bed. The noise appears several times randomly with no pattern but I was sure it’s from the hotel not by the vehicles driving by. I tried to ignore it and put my ear plugs in but keep getting woke up by this random vibrating noise. Eventually I decided to call the reception for help. The receptionist came to the room to tried to find out where the noise came from. When he was in the room, the noise didn’t appear at that time, so he was accusing me of lying and made me feel like I’m crazy. I was so frustrated I decided to pack my things and left the hotel in tears around 10.30pm that night.  

After a night of good sleep, I was able to think better. I remember the noise always appears twice and went quiet until the next time. Hence I believe the vibrating noise is from the hotel garage door opening and closing. My room number is 17 and the room must be above of or very close to the garage door on the ground floor.   

I don’t think this is acceptable. I don’t need much from a hotel. A working shower and a good night sleep is all I need. Unfortunately I didn’t get my good sleep with you and make things worse, I was not heard and belittled by you when there is an issue.  

I expect you to hear my complaint, investigate the issue and get back to me in due course.",location is the only good thing.,1.0,November 2023,"December 4, 2023",Budget Queen Room,2,Solo traveler,8,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0.0005578841224500832

Wonderful,"Parking getting out is pretty tight. staff sort of looked me over a couple of times I felt but overall we're professional and very good.

The first person on the first day was very friendly ""shakara""? Maybe. 

The hotel is much better than it used to be. Automatic doors etc are great.

The hotel has never been terrible it's always been value and it treats people with decency. Id recommend it to people.

Food is basic but fine for breakfast and the price is right. 

I think some hotels since Covid have gotten ahead of themselves and people are reconsidering travel.

This hotel is priced fair. 

I think it is good overall maybe just a little more friendly but also it's not unfriendly.","The rooms have gotten better at least those ones and the hotel has improved overall i think

However, I still could not sleep and had a bad headache next early morning. I complained ago. Another staff said he would report it to their team and they would do something.

Good staff but felt quite misled by pictures of room,"Booked room 'Superior Queen Room with solar skylight' specifically for bath, as it came up on a specific filtered search of on booking.com for rooms with baths. The photo clearly showed a bath in the room. When we got there the room looked very different from the photos and had no bath, we were informed that the rooms can be different. (While we were having this conversation at the desk another guest was making almost the exact same complaint to the other - that her superior queen room with solar skylight did not look like her photos although not specifically about the bath - so I feel it isn't just us)

The staff were very kind and were good enough to move us to a room that did have a bath, as that was essentially our sole purpose of renting a hotel room. The room however was of significantly lower quality than what we had paid for in the first place.
