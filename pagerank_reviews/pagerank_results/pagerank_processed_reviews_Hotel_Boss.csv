This hotel is only an option if anything else is booked - unacceptable for business travellers.,"These rooms are way to small relative to what you pay for. It is unacceptable for business travellers. The noise level from the outside is very high due to the extreme high frequency of guest changeovers, often whole families. The bathroom does not even have cups for tooth cleaning.

Disappointing,"The whole stay was a disappointment. I have stayed in 2-star hotels that offer you more and that are more spacious than this alleged 4-star.

The pictures of the rooms are very very deceiving, they are real, but taken in a way that make them look way bigger than they are. They feel like one of those “cube” hotels, but with the bare minimum space to walk around the bed. There was almost no space for luggage. We had to keep it closed all the time.

The bathroom is tiny. Trying to get dried inside the shower without touching the walls was nearly impossible.

In general it felt more like camping in an RV than being in a hotel.

Also, only one side table (there was space for two small ones), no night lamps, no minibar…

The mattress was quite hard, as well as the pillows. If you like that, you’ll feel in heaven. But I prefer softer pillows, so I went down to ask for an extra one. It was brought to the room without a pillow case. So I had to go down again (tbf, the reception guy was as surprised as me).

I think the hotel has an “expectations” problem. I have stayed in worse hotels for cheap, but at least they don’t try to sell it as something else. Maybe if they told it as it is, I wouldn’t be writing this.

Wish I stayed somewhere else.,"The rooms are very cramped and crowded. A room for 4 could barely hold my party and our luggages with very limited space to move around. Only stay here if you're very comfortable with the people you are traveling with. Luckily we were, otherwise this would have been very uncomfortable. 

The coin laundry at this facility is poorly managed and very expensive. S$5 for wash and S$5 for dry for only about 45 minutes, with additional S$1 for detergent. It's located outdoors in this tiny corner that is hard to walk through since everyone is crowding around the machines waiting to dump other people's laundry out as soon as the load is finished. The control panel is hard to understand, since for some reason they taped over the S$5 option with black tape, so it made a single wash load S$10. When I asked for help they just told me that was the cost and refused to come help. Then I removed the black tape on my own and found that there were cheaper load options. Staff was very rude and unhelpful in this regard. The dryer didn't even dry our clothes so we ended up paying S$5 for wet laundry that we had to hang dry in our room overnight and into the next day.","I liked that the hotel was located right in front of a bus stop that was serviced by many bus lines.

Great Value for Money!,During the night we could hear a buzzing noise (perhaps air-conditioning units in neighbouring rooms).

It's not the most luxurious hotel I have ever stayed in but provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay of 6 nights. The rooms were not huge but the two of us managed just fine, they were clean, and serviced daily. We didn't dine in the restaurant on an evening but breakfast was fantastic and great value.

HONEST REVIEW !!,"1st dislike how their TV keeps giving us problems. That we have to call the desk to bring in a technician.

2nd dislike how you guys handle things not making it strict. 

Mention 7.30am to 9.30am in the card which comes along with an access card to our room. 

Let me bring this up to your attention, Your swimming time please make it strict to avoid discomfort to other people who are trying to get some sleep and rest especially families with kids. 

Let me remind u I'm level 11 I even close my balcony door I can hear screaming and laughing till 10.30pm. I am waiting for the staff to chase them away since close at 9.30pm. So isn't there any staff hello... or security who took care of the swimming pool. So noisy and loud. Make me upset and pissed off so annoying hearing screaming and laughing after 10pm

I look at my balcony they are still swimming in the pool downstairs scream,making loud noises and giggling.
I have a 3 year old son and I am trying so hard to put him to sleep. 

I suggest please be strict with timing wise for other comfort of customers. 

3rd 
The room service cleaning took so long to clean outside my door has been around the whole day. Nobody pickup the trash? Geezz...imagine if it's my son's diapers disposal with stool omg wait the whole half day just to clean n take it away?

Service please be more prompt.. paid $250.35 per night isn't cheap hor remember that... That is just the room not included breakfast at $16 per pax. 

I even tried the breakfast but neither me nor my son seemed to dislike the breakfast buffet. Not much variety Prata too thin cereal not appealing.. just wasted the breakfast each at $16. I suggest if your booking room yes breakfast don't waste your money on breakfast with not much option to eat or just normal Prata Or etc2 for morning breakfast.",I enjoy the view and the sounds to every time of Muslim prayers.

It was average.,"1. The room condition wasn’t good at all. For the price, I expected a room that was more spacious and that was of good quality. For instance, the wall’s paint was so scratched out which is ridiculous for what I paid for an a 4 star hotel. Or how to chair for the table was in such bad shape. 

2. How is there no room service???? 

3. The staff at the reception was not kind and welcoming at all. It was a middle aged Chinese man wearing glasses and a suit. When my partner asked a question, he didn’t even look up to respond and answered in a very bogus manner.

Poor,"This was our second stay in one trip. We had to stay for one more day even after facing the below mentioned issues in the same hotel as we had already pre booked it earlier.

There were a lot of issues which I am stating below:
1. 5 out of 10 staff were rude.
2. It is mentioned that it is a 4 star property and rightly so the hotel lobby looks grand but the room sizes are extremely small. They call it a superior room but nothing in it is Superior.
3. When asked for water, we were told that either to go down to the lobby to take it or to wait for half an hour more for them to send. This was after half an hour of waiting.
4. Luggage was rightly sent to our rooms on reaching. While checking out, we were asked to take them down ourselves which is totally unexpected.
5.  They clean rooms once in two days which also they do half heartedly.
6. There is no cupboard or wardrobe in the room. They don't give basic amenities. They don't give iron if asked for and much more.
7. When asked to upgrade our room, as rooms were available, we were asked to pay double the difference for room of what was available online. We offered to pay standard charges as per their portal but they wanted us to pay penalties too despite the fact that their room was in no ways superior as mentioned while booking.","We had booked two rooms.

Poor,"1) Room size was tiny. Barely any room to move. No table in between the beds to keep the phone for charging also. No closet. Only 1 bag stool the other one has to be kept in small tiny place. 
2) The bathroom as well..esp. the shower was so tiny for someone like me who is just 5ft 1 inch. No hand towels..only bath towels + a towel to lay below your feet.
The shower head is at 5ft 2 inch height which made it awkward for me as well to have a bath. Imagine anyone taller than that.
3) Now the food situation is the worst. They do not have an in-house kitchen..so everything (breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner & room service) depends on the only restaurant inside the hotel Salt and Pepper. 
Imagine catering to more than 1K- 2K people for breakfast in a 30 seat restaurant. The first day breakfast was pure chaos. It was so crowded that we barely took a few bread slices, butter and tea & sat outside.
We chose to have dinner from their room-service menu. The tomato+mushroom bruschetta were 6 slices of stale french bread with no olive oil on it and 3 with tomato & mushroom topping each. Such a bad choice. 

This hotel requires a major upgrade. With 100 rooms per floor and 10-15 floors of rooms...that's just too much. The lobby is always filled with people leaving or coming or just hanging out. 
With these massive numbers, house keeping & bell hop become slow & are late in delivery of anything. We took our own luggage & brought it down ourselves. I had asked for a refill to the tea, sugar & whitener satches for which I had to call & remind them. BTW..no creamer for tea or coffee only whitner. And the kettle was not washed from inside for months. 

I will not be recommending this Hotel to anyone even on a budget.","The location.

Noisy/Uncomfortable/Spooky,"I didnt have a peaceful night at all. The sound proofing was so bad, nearby room  with Indian family guest opened their room door, chitchatting, laughing and kids shouting, next room to mine was guest with toddler keeps on crying, I managed to fell sleep when they all quiet down. 
Meanwhile around 3am, Im woken up with a clicking sound that was so annoying, Im tried to find where the clicking sound was, at first i guess its the blind rope beed hitting the wall so I raised it up to the hanger beside, but the on and off clicking sound didnt stop, it sounds was the same sound as someone pressing the spoilt on and off button of the remote control. Im so annoyed at the same time started to find the room spooky. My partner woken up and noticed that Im feeling uncomfortable, I told him about it but at that moment the sound was gone. He told me its maybe the rain drops outside the window. I covered myself with the blanket and tried to sleep but I still can hear it until I fell asleep.

Hotel Boss is a good place for a business or solo traveler who needs a place to sleep and shower!,"Hotel lobby is always crowded with lots of people, just sitting around the whole day! Room was really tiny and only good for a guest who just wanted a bed and shower. No space to even open your bags. We were traveling to three countries for four weeks and had two 28"" bags, had a struggle dealing with it. Room walls were not soundproof and you can hear all the conversations in the adjacent rooms.  Guests were very noisy and I know hotel can't do much about it, but the parties lasted way into the early morning hours and we lost sleep almost every night.  Breakfast buffet area was not clean, tables were cleaned with wet clothes which were used over and over again in all tables.  Tables were wet, sticky and unhygienic, not expected this in Singapore.  Also the staff in buffet area were not professionally trained and not helpful at all. 
Our biggest disappointment was,  we requested a room with city view but assigned a room without any view. Through balcony we were only able to see the neighbours' balcony and their drying cloths! Just wondering why we paid the extra.  Balcony had only one chair, but we are a couple, so played musical chair!! 
The original description said ""with city view"" as well I got an email from hotel that they will try to accommodate our request.  But they never even tried, just assigned one randomly.

not happy at all,"The rooms are very small. I booked a Superior Double Room (with Set Breakfast). The day we arrived, the receptionist said I had to pay for breakfast, claiming I hadn't booked a room with breakfast included. Additionally, they gave me a standard room and insisted that I had booked a standard room without breakfast.

When we went to the room, it was too small to even fit two hand luggage pieces. We had two big and two small suitcases. We returned to the receptionist to explain that the standard room was too small to accommodate our luggage, but they argued that this was the standard room size.

I then checked my booking details and remembered that I had booked a Superior Double Room. I went back to the receptionist and showed them the booking details. They then claimed that the room they gave us was indeed the Superior Double Room. I pointed out that they had initially told me it was a standard room, which left me very disappointed with their treatment.

After showing them proof of the breakfast included in my booking, they finally acknowledged it and gave me a small piece of paper with the date to take to the restaurant for breakfast.

OKay,rooms needs to be little better for higher rates,"The location of the accommodation is undoubtedly its standout feature—conveniently situated and easily accessible. However, when it comes to the rooms, there's a noticeable disparity between the size and the price paid. Despite booking the highest-tier option, the room size didn't reflect the expected upgrade.

Hopefully, the management considers enhancing the room amenities to better align with the pricing structure.

"Would stay again, better the devil you know..","The room was incredibly small, but just adequate for a single traveller.

The air-conditioning, not great. Probably OK of 1 or 2 nights, but 23 nights without any fresh air in the room an issue

Whilst the hotel had a lot of bars, restaurants and independent restaurants in the building, it lacked a coffee shop which I found inconvenient. 

There were 16 lifts. however the programming meant that getting down from the top floor (19th) was difficult during peak times as the lift would stop at every floor despite being full, and the other lifts unused.

There is a large vehicle access area for taxis etc, but also need to traverse this to get to two of the bars, especially in bad weather. The really need some hard segregation between the pedestrians and vehicles  as I felt it quite dangerous at busy times.","My city view room had an excellent view through a picture window, which made up for some of the shortcomings.

Disappointing to say the least. Not visiting again.,"Where do I start - my checkin was not smooth at all. First they gave me a key card which did not work even in lift or at the room. So went 10 floors down again to get that sorted. Then the room given was not the one I booked I call the reception and they say sorry the messed up. I don't know how that happens. I get in the room I notice dirty spoons, the lady comes and tells me we can't clean it you have to clean it. I don't know why she could not understand that I did not use them and they might be from a previous guest and so why should I clean it just give me a new one. I was there 4 days, they cleaned the room thrice but the spoon was not changed. Then in the name of environment they won't clean your room everyday. I understand not changing bed sheets but how can you say no to clean the bathroom, provide water or fresh towels for the next day. Unbelievable. The room wifi will not work after 10:30pm for some strange reason. The breakfast had the same menu for all the 4 days i was there. There was an issue on the breakfast (paid the fare with breakfast but the confirmation came without) before I started my trip is another issue altogether. Because of this they asked me to pay for the breakfast beforehand, they won't add it to your room account to pay while check-out. Strange, need money for any service upfront. When I was checking out they couldn't wait to say bye - no thank you for staying with us or please visit again or ask for feedback. I think that says a lot about the hotel.

"FIND ANOTHER HOTEL - UNCLEAN, UNSANITARY AND NEEDS A TOTAL REFURBISHMENT (except pool area!)","On arrival, after midnight, we were immediately greeted by a foul food odour in reception, and it followed us in the elevators & corridors. 
On our way to the room we walked through corridors with walls which looked like they'd been in a war, such were the scrapes (bullets?) and marks, the carpets so stained it may have be laid last century, and the actual door to our room bore witness to what looked like previous break-ins. (Had to double check we had arrived in Singapore, not some crime ridden US city!).
Our room was a disaster. Damaged walls, dirty floor, stink of old food (curry?), broken headboard, toilet seat broken and mirror which someone had obviously sneezed over! And even more evidence of someone having previously forced the door open - awful! 
Didn't even bother unpacking, went straight to reception to complain and change rooms... staff didn't look surprised and gave us another room. Apparently an upgrade... it wasn't! Basically the same room, but much cleaner.
The nightclub and bars under the hotel are quite sleazy looking and were still booming out music when I went outside for a cigarette at 1am, and for Singapore not to feel safe is unusual!
I think this hotel aims itself for a clientele from South Asia who maybe are too dignified to complain? So I'll complain on their and my behalf!
Breakfast is for South Asian clientele, which I don't mind, but be warned if you are looking for Western Buffet breakfast this is not available here!

Bad,"Almost everything about the hotel and the stay.
First of all, the room has really bad smoking 🚬 kind of smell when we first enter, although it says smoking is prohibited, but the smell was really bad.
Secondly, the wall had some kind of stains which is really not comfortable to see.
Thirdly, the room light was not so good, it's quite dim.
Fourthly, the most important part, the water ! The hot water was not flowing well and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. And the worst part is the water pressure was very small, sometimes strong, truly bad experience.
Lastly upon checkout, we requested concierge to help our bags to be brought down, they said their guys were busy and if I wanted to wait, I must wait 30 to 40mins. Such a shame.

Never ever comeback to this hotel. Sorry, first and last.

Bad,"The hotel is a come-and-go all the time. Reception isn't professional, they speak very bad English and the staff even doesn't try to understand or help you. They seem like bored and are not attentive. There are 2 breakfast types, one standard and halal. If you're not sure about which breakfast type you should take, the only explication reception gives you is: ""One is on level 1 and the other on level 4"".  So you have to figure it out on your own or insist - terrible service. The entrance hall has a terrible smell of petrol as the taxis come and go constantly and the smell enters from the covered parking area inside the entrance hall. 

Breakfast is mostly for asian/ indian guests, but ok. Floors in the breakfast hall are slippery and dirty, a women felt down as she slipped on the floor. Dangerous!

Let's talk about the rooms... we seemed to be landed in a horror story. The room is a small little box with no daylight and you can't open the windows. The bathroom door was scratched, air conditioning was very noisy, WiFi connection comes and goes and is so bad that you even can't read the news...we had to go to a nearby bar to do our online check-in for our next-day flight. Annoying! Besides they forgot a clean cloth in the room and we still found water from the former guests in the kettle. Disgusting. 

The pool area: only 10 sun loungers (no joke) for a hotel which is able to accommodate more than 1000 guests, most of them cracked and broken.

Luckily we only stayed 1 night but we'd never ever repeat. We travelled already to Singapore and stayed in different hotels - this one doesn't deserve 4 stars.

Think twice if you're considering booking this place.","The location, close to the metro, shopping centres and food stalls.",1.0,November 2022,"November 24, 2022",Superior Twin Room,1,Couple,6.7,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,0.00034252731771854345

disappointing and not what we expected,"Sadly, the day that we arrived we got to our family room and it was disgusting. Within 5 minutes of being there all of our feet were black, which my little ones quickly transferred to the white bedding when they jumped on them, the floor clearly hadn't been washed for some time. 
Our first night, the Wi-Fi went down and we were unable to watch TV or use tablets etc. Not usually an issue, but when travelling with small children, something to keep them settled is a must - especially when there is no space in the room itself to play! We reported the Wi-Fi issue the next day, sadly we were told this couldn't be fixed and so the next morning we had to move rooms. (also quite annoying when you have already unpacked for 4 people). I did complain to the manager about the dirty room, no Wi-Fi and having to move - to which i was offered complimentary late checkout for our stay for the inconvenience which I appreciated very much. 
Our second room Wi-Fi wasn't great, but it was better for the majority of the time. We did not have a cleaner come in daily to re stock on water, coffee etc. and so had to call and request these to be brought to us (twice), which is another disappointing factor as I would expect this to be completed daily given the price we paid. 
Lastly, if you want to iron your clothing you will need to travel to the 4th floor where the pool is located. These are not provided or supplied in your rooms, I suspect because there is not enough space.","The location was brilliant, very close to underground and bus stops, central location and very easy to get around.

4. Luggage was rightly sent to our rooms on reaching. While checking out, we were asked to take them down ourselves which is totally unexpected.
5.  They clean rooms once in two days which also they do half heartedly.

Pick somewhere else. Anywhere else!!!,"Most of the staff are incredibly rude. They tend to blame the guest for any problems. The breakfast is borderline disgusting, looks like reheated leftovers from last night. Not to mention the absolute bedlam of trying to get a table. I know this is a budget hotel (at SG$350 per night) so we expect a commensurate level of service but surely this should not mean an aggressive lack of. When I tried to speak to a housekeeper about the stain on our sheets having come back from a day out, she had the gall to tell me that ""no housekeeping"" whilst pushing her trolley away. Excuse me? Then when I asked for a pillow at reception, they said maximum 4pax despite accepting a Booking.com reservation for 2 adults and THREE children. The reception lady then proceeded to blame me for trying to get my child in for free! Excuse me again?!! You accept a reservation and then blame me? Yesterday when seeking a taxi, we noticed not many cabs coming. We waited for ages and it took me to ask the concierge after 10 minutes of nothing, who then informed me - very hard to get taxi now, shift change. I mean : why not say that first?

In addition, there are suggested quiet hours between 10pm and 7am - but nobody enforces and therefore nobody cares. 

This place feels and looks like a multi storey prison. If you are unlucky enough to get an inward facing room, you basically never see natural light.

Having said that, the lady who checked me in was nice, although the check in process was painfully slow for some reason. Also the concierge on day 2 helped a lot by helping book us a taxi on his own phone app. Sadly, these two people are working for a company that is so poor at basic functions that they are merely holding a thin line of service.",Location is good.

Also the hotel only provided house keeping cleaning service once every 2 days which is fairly odd.

Dorminatry and nothing else!!,"i didn't like almost everything about this place.
absolutely shockingly Small in almost every aspect. it is very fancy outside with no substance inside.
the concierge did not even tried to great us or help with luggage. There were so many people in reception that you felt as another small fish in the tank. We were greeted by reception staff that just followed ""the book"" and protocol to check us in and move to the next guest
Rooms are shockingly small and all photography has been done with wide lenses and marking purposes.
when you are in the room and the bag is on the floor to take things out (note- there is no other place for it at all anyway) you need to jump over the bag to get to your bed.
It's a shocker for the amount of money they charge.
as i wrote a review on a trip advisor, i missed a few key signs in the first place:
why would a good hotel put a photo of laundry in the featured photos??!!
I have been asked to pay in full for the whole stay at check in!! what it means to us is that it's a point of no return - you can't check out after the first ruined night and move to another place.
the third one - watch for the hangers in the room above the TV !! the rooms are so ""practical"" that there is no space for a wardrobe!
before checking I sent some messages - there was no reply either.
The bathroom is so small that there is no space to put a toilet paper roll, and there is NO Toilet paper at all. There are  paper tissues somewhere above your head.
Also, you can forget about sitting on the toilet normally!! - there is no space to put your leg normally - the show glass is next to the seat.!
if you get an internal corner room, you will face another window 2 meters away from another hotel room, and if you're not feeling yourself already in the prison and want to look outside, you will see reflection of yourself which is not limited to your own but also reflections or views of all your neighbours across multiple floors ..","Tell you honestly there was nothing to like about it except location .,.. sorry.",3.0,September 2022,"October 10, 2022",Superior Twin Room,2,Family,6.7,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0.0003200603947693119

It doesn’t have a cabinet beside the bed while the socket there is a meter above the floor, I then understand why there are sound of moving the furniture on the floor above in the evening and early morning as likely the chair or other furniture are needed to move to act like table or cabinet.

Disappointed,"The toilet had so much of stains on the walls and the sink couldnt drain well. The tissue quality was bad, shower pressure was high and shower head couldnt stay on the holder. The room had a balcony which had a sticky stain on the floor causing us the inconvenience of having to wear out slippers whenever we needed to go into the balcony. There was no bedroom slippers available. The YOUTUBE was not playing smoothly and it disrupted our entertainment plans to have a sing along session.  We anticipated fun time at the pool, but the minute i went in wearing my goggles, I could see so much of impurities floating in the water. It was a disgusting sight to see clumps of hair floating in the water as well. The water was so cloudy and after a while we saw a cleaner using a nets to fish the impurities out of the pool. Could he have cleaned the whole pool using the net? And he was cleaning the pool while guests were still swimming. It was very disgusting. I will never choose to return back to this hotel. The hygiene and cleanliness despite covid season is very bad. I am utterly disappointed that tourist will have to see and compare the state of a hotel in Singapore.

"Nope, not for me - Hotel Boss is yuck & rooms are small with too many guests and not enough space","We arrived from our flight at nearly midnight and the reception area was busy with people sitting and standing around everywhere, some with suitcases, but I have no idea what they were all doing there in the reception at that hour, it was so loud. There was a roped line up section for reception so we stood with our suitcases in the line-up area and people just kept ignoring the line-up (we were the only people lining up) and they just kept walking straight up to the desk.... Eventually 1 staff member called us over and 1 of the guy's that had walked up to the reception desk trying to push in just stood there the whole time watching us check-in....

The room was the smallest I have ever stayed in and not very well cleaned or maintained - I would describe it as yuck! I felt sick when I walked in, it was just gross. No space for 2 suitcases, the bathroom was tiny. We had a room with a balcony and I think the balcony may have been about the same size as the room, so that was where we stayed when we were there except when we needed to sleep or shower etc, but to be honest, we just tried to avoid going back to the hotel. The bed was very small also.

If anyone was in the hallway, you could hear them very clearly from the room. You could also hear the people in neighboring rooms. The walls are paper thin.

After a while we figured out that Hotel Boss is pretty close to Little India Singapore and most of the other guests were Indian.

Breakfast at the hotel was the worst experience for us during our stay. This hotel can accommodate 1500 guests, yet the breakfast area can only seat about 60 people. So basically you walk into the breakfast restaurant and there are people everywhere with no tables available. It was an absolute pig-sty! Food everywhere, all over the benches, all over the floor. The staff were trying to clear tables but couldn't get through because there were just waaaaay too many people in there.",The only positive thing I can say is the staff were nice and doing the best they can under the circumstances.

Disappointing,"First of all the Lobby,always crowded and gives you a  feeling as if you have walked into a market.

The breakfast what can I say very basic,tables are not cleaned ,cramped with people who comes from all sides to take food worst than a fish market

Awful and disappointing,"The hotel is very modern and set up to receive a large number of guests, but it is not without faults. I spent 6 nights in a noisy room which to define a “storage closet” is a compliment. To make the situation even worse, the clogged bathroom sink which was unblocked only after three days and four requests for intervention.
My reservation was for a ""superior room with balcony and breakfast set"" which, according to the description by Booking, should have been 18m2. In reality, the measured surface area, including the bathroom, was only TWELVE square meters. The photographs, of course, are very misleading and show a situation of much higher quality than reality.
The balcony was on the internal courtyard, therefore with a very limited view, but the real problem was the noise deriving from the air conditioning system placed on the roof, whose noisy motors severely limited the possibility of remaining outside. Furthermore, the access door to the balcony, lacking a valid seal, let most of the noise filter inside the room, making sleep very difficult.
The problems don't end there. The included breakfast offers very limited choice and no variation from day to day. Basically for six days we always ate the same things (often cold). The only positive note is the freshly ground coffee.
Extremely negative final judgment, considering the price. The hotel would be 4 stars, but I would say that maybe just 2 stars would be enough. Only two positive things: the swimming pool and the always scrupulous cleaning.",the swimming pool and the always scrupulous cleaning,2.0,November 2022,"November 27, 2022",Superior Double Room with Balcony (Set Breakfast),6,Couple,6.7,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0.00027835867978136166

The breakfast was not worth the amount I paid for as could have few more choices included
Secondly The rooms were not sound proof as I  could hear the next door neighbour shouting and celebrating late night or early morning until 0400  specially after me having tiring days

They never say thank you or sorry. 
I asked for flip flop first time when I go to out for dinner, when I am back passed the reception, remind them again, they said ok ok, we deliver now, after one hour nothing to be delivered. I called number 0 to reception but no body picked up. I need to go down to the reception at 11:20pm to asked them again for flip flop and the receptionist said, the staff is really busy.
By the way, I just want to confirm that “0” is call to the reception, doesn’t it? She said “yes”, then why I called no one answer, she replied me with a really impolite way that “the person that pick up phone may be busy or maybe go toilet” but without saying any sorry for letting you wait long or something…. 
The shower head in bathroom is broken, either really hot water or cold, not warm water. Toilet bowl has yellow stain on the seat and dark moul on corner of shower room as well.

Asked for extra towels the other day. Not given. When housekeeping came with extra towels, they were shoved into our face and he left very unhappily. Room slippers were promised, also not given.

One of the nights, we went back with a broken tap. The screw of the tap was loose and some of the screws dropped out with gush of yellowish water from the tap. We had to fix the tap ourselves as we couldn't be bothered anymore. We were told Singapore is safe to drink off the tap, we were both relieved we didn't!

Would not reccomend,"The initial room smelt like smoke and was horrible. Complained and relocated room which smelt better. 
I had paid for a balcony - do not bother because it faces everyone else's balcony so no actual view. The room was so small that our luggage did not fit (x2 cases) we had to leave these on the balcony. The room wallpaper was horrible and taped together with I don't know what. The shower and bathroom were OK however the logistics of the shower was awkward - the door opened out not inwards seems picky but it was so small it was near impossible to get in and out.
They cleaned the room every 2 days - we asked for toilet paper and the lady didn't understand so I took it off her trolly which she didn't mind but then we couldn't fit it properly - another awkward aspect. 

The overall room was completely a cat fish to the photos showed online as well as the gym it is tiny!! 
The pool looked OK although we didn't use due to busy schedules. 

I don't think it was value for money especially since I paid extra to have a balcony which was utter pointless. 

Overall if your not bothered and just want to sleep great but I felt completely cat fished and wouldn't have spent what I did if I had known.

Breakfast is bedlam, not very clean or hygienic as the busboys only collect used plates and cutlery, they don't always wipe down with cleanser.

The restaurant staff were rude when we asked to sit inside the restaurant as we didn't want to sit out in the hotel lobby, and they wouldn't let us because our 6yr old very well Behaved daughter was with us. So we decided to eat elsewhere. 

Breakfast was carnage, completely packed in to a tiny room and was a free for all to grab what food was brought out. Not enjoyable and the food we did manage to get was poor quality. 

The swimming pool was freezing, but worst of all it was full of long black hairs. Every length I swam I got hairs in my mouth and stuck around my fingers, absolutely disgusting. The surface of the water also had a film of grease or something on top.

Furthermore, there was dust on the bed and a hanger in the room. I informed the front desk who handled my checking in to remind the housekeeper of my request for cleaning.

I waa having breakfast with my family when we saw a group of indian guests picking up the fruits using hands instead of the tongs provided. That is very unhygienic. I understand it was a busy morning but staff should be more vigilant and wary. At least 1 staff should be standing at each station instead of clearing the tables even before the guests leave. 

I have also another feedback. There should be more security rounding the swimming pool areas.

Disaster Hotel - It changed my image of Singapore forever. Avoid it if you find another Hotel.,"Everything else there is a disaster. There is certainly racial profiling by the Check-in staff, so much that I gave a written complaint after the 2nd night. 

The breakfast at Jubilious is horrible at the 4th floor. Get it changed to Salt and Pepper if you are alloted otherwise.

Generally the staff both at the check-in and at the restaurant are very rude. They have their prejudices and if you fall in their Stereotyping they don't treat you with respect. 

There is absolutely nothing they can help with. This Hotel has ruined Singapore for me and I would in general never go there again anyway. 

This Hotel appears for a reason on the top of cheaper 4* Hotels. Their service is miserable.
